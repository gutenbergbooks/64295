GEORGE WILLIAMS, ESQ.<br />
<span class="smaller">TREASURER OF THE LONDON ASSOCIATION,<br />
AND</span><br />
<span class="smcap">To the various Members of the
Young Men’s Christian Associations
in the United Kingdom and
America</span>:</p>

<p>To you I beg to offer the four following
addresses—they may be helpful in your service
for young men. Thousands there are
who watch your Associations with deep and
grateful interest. By some persons, it may
be, your aims are misunderstood. I have
never learned that you condemned other literary
and recreative associations; but you
have felt that there was room for one distinctively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Christian. You do not frown on
joy and pastime; you do not disparage
literary education; but you have not been
ashamed to avow that your object is to save
young men from irreligion, and to promote
among yourselves spiritual and Christian
culture. To not a few it therefore appears
that not only are your associations among
the very noblest, but that they preëminently
meet the demand of these times. Reading-rooms
and opportunities for social enjoyment
are doubtless most desirable, but it is true
piety that is the safety and mainspring of
prosperity to a community.</p>

<p>To the best and most distinguished men
of this era it seems that the stability and
progress of the great Christian nations depend
upon the maintenance of Christianity
in its integrity, and as honestly derived from
the supernatural teaching of the New Testament
Scriptures. We have, however, come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
upon an age of the gravest perils. What has
been the spring-head and occasioner of these
perils? This: Men have become estranged
from intercourse with God, and from the
thoughts of the holy and spiritual world.
No longer living in believing relation to
the Father of their spirits, they have lost
the light whereby all things become luminous
and harmonized. Three errors now lay
straight in their path; and to one or other
of these, according to temperament, they
have been drawn: materialistic worldliness,
that inclines man’s whole attentions to the
interests, pleasures, and gains of the world
of sense; scientific atheism, whereby a small
minority, happily, of scientific expounders
attempt to bow God out of his universe, and
to resolve all creation into spontaneous life
and self-development; intellectual rationalism,
that makes man his own savior, denies
sin and atonement, moral weakness and Divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
grace. It would appear as if Satan’s
last and deadliest assault upon the hopes and
progress of the race was to be the denial of
the self-existent God. Assuredly, let the
control of this belief go, and this vital consciousness
be lost, and the wide floodgates
of iniquity and of lawlessness will be opened,
and nothing can save millions from relapsing
into barbarism. Even Mr. Buckle has taught
that a materialistic philosophy led the way
to the horrors of the French Revolution. At
such a time, then, as this, Christian associations,
with objects so clearly defined, and
where arrangements are primary to secure
intercourse with Christ and with a spiritual
world, meet the deepest want of the age.
Moreover, who so well as young men can
work among the young? You know the
snare that is spread for their feet; “the cup
that is poisoned and reached out for their
hand; the eye that glares death which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
fixed upon them in secret.” Every good
man must, therefore, wish you encouragement
in your labor to save and ennoble your
companions. You are blessing your country
and your times. Your work will be fruitful
and abide. Thousands who now do not understand
you will afterwards pour benedictions
over your memories. You, in an age of
speculative and moral dangers, will be held
to have been benefactors. The days are
surely coming when above all other days
men will be needed who, by their Christian
enlightenment and sanctity, can impart
steadiness and elevation to their times. Then
the men to whom the age will turn will be
men with hearts and understandings which
have been animated by Christian faith. To
secure such a generation is your high aim.
May God prosper your purpose and your
devotion.</p>

<p>To you, then, I dedicate my little book,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
which attempts to portray some of the aspects
of modern life, and some of the alarming
and imperilling temptations with which
modern habits and modes of opinion are surrounding
young men.</p>

<p>The first lecture was printed in a separate
form; but as the whole edition has been disposed
of, it has been thought better to let it
now appear with the others.</p>

</div>

<p>The following words are addressed to
young men by one who, not very long ago,
was one of them. If they are serious and
earnest, they are non the less sympathetic
and brotherly.</p>

<p>On the mind of some thoughtful men there
is the fear that England has seen her best
days, that her sun is going down, and that a
decline like that of other great nations has
begun. This is probably the language of
mere pessimists. Albeit, even hopeful men
have reason enough to be anxious. There
is a frost of skepticism touching the young
mind of England. There is a dread of enthusiasm
which bodes ill. Young men stand
in our great cities amid juggling expedients,
glittering pretences, specious deceits, unscrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
graspings after wealth or position
the tides of temptation flow fast around them;
a high civilization has made wickedness very
facile and seductive; veteran experts in vice
are found everywhere, and the very streets
are allowed to be fevered walks of lustful
solicitations.</p>

<p>If England is to be saved and is to have a
great future, it will be through her young
men. They are the hope of society. A man,
therefore, who is indifferent to their moral
dangers and welfare is no friend to his country.
I will make, then, no apology while I
speak to them earnestly of their life, and
what it may be and can be. No doubt there
are scores of empty and frivolous young men
who can never be won to thoughtfulness.
May God help them; for the look-out that is
before them is awful. But there are many
of a different stamp, and may their Father
and mine help me to articulate his yearning
thoughts about them.</p>

<p>My brother, I am not about to speak to
you of what belongs to others, nor mainly of
the duties you owe to others; but of what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
you imperatively owe to yourself, and what
emphatically belongs to you. You have an
existence in which the grandest and the most
terrific possibilities are wrapped up. Life
has been given to you. What significance is
in the word! Life, with its unknown treasures
and vast capabilities; life, with all its
resources and opportunities; life, with all its
rich enjoyments and pleasurable unfoldings;
life, endowed with consciousness and divine
faculties; life, which beginning with the
sweetness of infancy, and passing through
the open-heartedness of school days, can
ripen into a beauty and strength and force
of goodness which, through the long ages of
immortality, will find accessions of ever-augmenting
felicity, power, and blissfulness. My
brother, when I discourse to you of the value
of this transcendent gift of life, exaggeration
is hardly possible. No language of men or
angels can worthily set forth the full meaning
of this gift. You, among creatures, are
obviously destined to rank with the noblest on
the basest of beings; the elevation with which
you come into the universe is the measure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the grandeur to which you may rise, or the
degradation to which you may fall.</p>

<p>The question therefore comes, What do
you intend to do with this your life? You
have come to an age when this question confronts
you. You ignore your rationality by
evading it. The two paths of honor and dishonor
are now before you: which do you
intend to take? I put the inquiry in this
form—What will you do with your life?—because
millions of men have been ruined, not
so much through wrong intention as through
want of thought. They have drifted into an
evil course through a passive unthinkingness.
It is not that they have resolved to do bad
things, but they have not resolved to do good
ones. Instead of being masters of themselves,
sad to say, they have not even belonged
to themselves. On their forehead might
have been once written, “We are open to become
the possession of whatsoever shall make
capture of us.” Instead of controlling, they
have been borne along by outward things,
like a little boat in a dangerous stream, not
carefully rowed and guided, but empty, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
inviting any unskilled or wicked hand to become
its master.</p>

<p>There are young men possessing all the
capacities for a dignified and manly conduct
theirs, through the hard industry of others,
are all the qualifications of education and
competence. They are surrounded with circles
offering every facility to happiness and
pure enjoyment. And what do these young
men do with all this wealth of possession?
I will sketch a few of the courses into which
they permit themselves to be seduced. One,
just out of his teens, affects a manly superiority;
calls “the governor” slow; orders his
tailor to make garments in a “fast” fashion;
cultivates an elegant beard; secures a massive
chain, and if possible, a splendid ring.
His boots are a very important item to his
manliness; and then what deliberation upon
the color of his gloves, and the flexibility of
his cane! As he steps from the door of his
plodding father, he puts a finish to his appearance
by lighting a cigar, and with a hat
à la mode, walks out, a ready prey for the
painted woman, and an advertisement for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
men on the look-out for unsophisticated
manhood. I do not say that a young man
may not have a gold chain, and trousers
made in the height of fashion, if he likes—there
is no religion in not having these
things; but for the sake of all that is manly,
do not let a young man think that this is to
make a worthy use of life—to be a show
thing to be looked at in the streets.</p>

<p>But a young man may have higher aims;
he may be somewhat literary in his tastes;
may have studied rules of etiquette, and may
select associations that are irreproachable.
He permits his vanity, however, to grow into
a chronic craving for admiration. He affects
insensibility to attract attention; falls into
the modern fashion of a supercilious apathy;
looks unimpassioned under the most eventful
circumstances, and twirls the points of his
moustache with elegant <i lang="fr">nonchalance</i>. Repudiating
all domestic and common interests,
he becomes valueless to humanity. The most
beautiful emotions of man’s nature become
frigid. His self-absorption grows into a conceit
which relieves others from the duty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
considering him. He never blesses, is never
blessed. Ineffective in youth, unloved in
manhood, he becomes testy and splenetic in
old age, and dies at length unmissed and unmourned.
And this is all he has made of a
life that once bore so much of promise.</p>

<p>There is another, over whom my heart’s
affections linger with a longing solicitude:
I mean the clever and facetious young man.
He has quick parts, can sing well, or give
recitations; ever on the look-out for fun, he
heaps up accumulating stores of witticisms
and repartee; and can repeat in character,
Mrs. Caudle, Mrs. Brown, or the newest
offering of this literary school. No circle of
his friends is complete without him; the
evening party must be delayed if he is engaged;
every body likes him—young men and
ladies alike call him “such a good fellow.”
And there is much that is good in him—his
readiness and ability to make hours of recreation
brighter are not to be despised; but
his kind-heartedness and endowments fit him
for something grander than to be a man who
merely amuses society. He himself suffers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
loss; neglect of solid reading and of elevated
thoughts lowers his own tone; the moral
which he tacks on to the end of his recitation
fails to clear the balance-sheet of his conscience
in better hours; the very friends that
he has charmed will seek another than him in
the important moments of their life. He will
find himself set aside ere long; his influence
will die with the vivacity of youth; he has
no acquirements that are cared for to carry
into riper manhood; and then nothing is
more revolting than the merely farcical and
comic old man. This is all <em>he</em> has made of
life; he has been the butterfly for sunny
hours, and has gone out when sterner days
came.</p>

<p>Would that my descriptions might cease
here; but the tale of failure has not run out.
There are young men with the pathway of
honor open before them, but who turn from
it, and in pompous dash care for none of the
things that would make for their peace.
Like dogs kept hungry, that their scent after
the game may be keener and more impelling,
they slip the leash of what they term their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
“mother’s apron-string,” and burst upon life
with a dare-devil spirit that defies control.
The shades of evening find them prowling
under the mask of darkness after every
pernicious gratification. Their imaginations
have been polluted with the vile literature
secretly circulated. From the dice or billiard-table
they go to the lighted hall, where
prostitutes decked in fine apparel mingle in
the waltz and ply their miserable arts, and
thence to the house where I will not follow,
and of which the Scriptures say, that “is the
way to hell, going down to the chambers of
death.”</p>

<p>A young man in a London warehouse was
solicited to spend such a night as I have
glanced at. He refused. “What a fool you
are to be so dull,” said the tempter. “We’ll
wait a while and see who is the fool,” said
the young man. In ten years’ time the tempter
was in a dishonored grave, and the other
was rising to affluence.</p>

<p>You young men who sneer at religion as
weakness and call godliness hypocrisy, it is
you who are the hypocrites. You have risen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
many a morning after a night of sin, and
have felt how satiety and loathing were making
deep footprints in your nature. You
have seen the shamelessness and hollowness
of wickedness, and have been too cowardly
to say that you saw it. You have laughed
at virtue while you were bearing agonies in
your flesh which were horrible and indescribable.
In ten years the tempter I have spoken
of was in his grave; and if the brief life
and dreadful end of thousands of young men
in England could be portrayed, it would be
the most awful tragedy ever told. Men would
be horrified as they read it, and the ghastly
memory would haunt them for years. Ah,
men do not know it. These young men go
from the great cities to die in country homes,
or they lie solitary in the upper chambers of
lodging-houses in back streets. Angel sisters
are kept from sights which they could not
comprehend. Nurses shrink from the foul
and loathsome atmosphere. And this is what
they have made of life—a murdered manhood;
not living out half their days: a past
all loss, a future all blackness. Oh, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
are our tears if they do not fall over numbers
who are dying every day in such chambers
and with such demons of remembrance?</p>

<p>I have read somewhere of an eagle in the
Far West. Soaring with steady wing, he saw
far below him the grand scenes of American
nature, clothed in the first snows of early
winter. As he rose higher towards the blue
heaven, his keen eye saw floating on the distant
river, whose margin was already frost-bound,
the carcass of a huge buffalo. He
paused in his upward flight; descended to
settle and revel on this feast of corruption.
He was borne calmly down the stream towards
the fall and the rapids which lay below.
Gorged with his foul meal, with drooping
wing and dormant energies, he slept on the
fœtid mass, and amid the oozing putrefaction.
The blood, stiffened by the frost,
bound his feet to the remains of the carcass;
and onwards was he borne until the roar
of the cataract thundered on his ear. He
struggled for liberty; his powers had been
enfeebled with satiety; his drooping wings
were bound to the frozen blood; his wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
cries awoke the echoes; he made frantic
efforts to throw off his horrid companion;
looked up to the blue heaven he had abandoned.
It was too late: hurried over the
rapid, he was sucked into the boiling cataract,
and dashed to destruction on the rocks
beneath. How does such an illustration find
its analogy in human life! “His own iniquity,”
saith the Scripture, “shall take the
wicked himself, and he shall be holden with
the cords of his sins.” There is a deep and
awful mystery in the downward progress of
souls, when he who once was the master of
sin becomes the “slave of sin.” Alas, there
are scores of men in every neighborhood who
would give all they have to begin life again.
There was a time when they never intended
to be vicious; but step by step they lowered
themselves. Shame, truth, self-respect died.
The lower elements of their nature first were
freely indulged, then became importunate,
then exacting, then domineering, then uncontrollable.</p>

<p>Dear young man, the pride of a mother,
the hope of a father, with an intensity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
yearning love I conjure you to pause ere you
go into the way of sinners. If your feet have
turned aside, retrace, I beseech you, your
steps. Your strong “I will” now, may,
through God’s mercy, turn you from the pit
of infamy. But soon weaker will be your
will, dimmer your sense of moral beauty,
more desperate your passions, till at length
you will feel bound, and then find yourself
borne over the rapids a lost and helpless
wreck.</p>

<p>But our view of life demands other considerations
than those that relate to time and
personal dishonor. It is a grand thing to
live. A thousand times have I blessed God
for this great gift of life. But it is serious
also. Life has its <em>responsibilities</em>. Influence,
like all things else, is imperishable. Nothing
perishes. The leaves of autumn do not perish;
they enrich the earth. The fuel of our
fires sends curling upwards its light smoke,
which bears its properties for other uses.
The broken fragments of the mountains,
through torrent and tempest, nourish plants
and renovate the earth. Not an act you perform,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
not a word you speak, can wholly perish.
It was probably this that Jesus Christ
meant when he spoke of the idle words for
which we shall give account at the day of
judgment; that is, our words which go from
us as light as air may be making others better
or worse, and carrying forward their consequences
to the judgment. Sin is imperishable.
Sin, like the soul, has immortality
stamped on it: when once done, <em>it cannot be
undone</em>. Even a saved man’s sins are imperishable
in the consequences. David, the king
of Israel, sinned; alas, how pitilessly! He
repented, and poured out a psalm of contrition
that has ever since been the liturgy of
humbled souls, and every verse of which
seems vocal with a groan; but he could not
undo the sin. In his own days the enemies
of truth blasphemed through him, and since
that time, in every generation, wicked men
have encouraged themselves in wickedness
because of that great crime, and the atheist
has barbed his arrow in the blood of that
murder. Voltaire, when he came to die,
longed that his blasphemies against Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
should be expunged from his writings. Ah,
he wished what was impossible. His errors
led to all the horrors of the French Revolution,
and have shattered the peace of thousands
since. A drunkard may obtain forgiveness;
but his example may have taught
his own son to brutalize himself. A young
man may turn away from the evil courses he
followed; but he may leave the silly youth
whom he first tempted to go floating down
to the bottomless pit.</p>

<p>There is a thought that often appals me.
It is nothing, as it seems, for the seducer to
play upon innocence, to instil poison into her
sweet affections and her maidenly instincts.
He has done, as he thinks, a manly thing
when he has crumpled up the beautiful
flower of her chastity, and left it to be fouled
in the mire. Ah, hard is the father’s shame
and the brother’s scorn she bears. Cold are
the streets that she treads at night, and lonely
is the garret where she soon lies down to
die. What cares he? Perhaps in a beautiful
home he has forgotten her and her child.
His turn comes at length to die. If conscience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
puts in a reminder, he calls the deed
an “indiscretion” of his youth, which signifies
little. O man, it <em>shall</em> signify; as sure as
there is a God in heaven, thou shalt meet
again that lost one to whom thou didst open
the door of shame, of infamy, and of ruin.
Her own lips shall tell thee how thou didst
help to put out in her all that is pure, and to
send her into the streets an outcast. It <em>shall</em>
signify; that child of neglect shall claim thee
as its father—an unerring finger shall point
it to thee. Before God and holy angels it
shall tell thee of its bare infant feet on snowy
street-flags, of night watchings at omnibus
steps, and of the ignorance, and wretchedness,
and foul examples, through which its
struggling life was passed, and which left
it no chance of virtue. From thee it shall
demand account of those paternal duties
which thou didst incur and didst never discharge.
Yes, it shall signify. Oh, there is a
solemn irony of Scripture when it saith,
“Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and
let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy
youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and in the sight of thine eyes; <em>but know thou,
that for all these things God will bring thee into
judgment. Therefore remove the cause of sorrow
from thy heart, and put away evil from
thy flesh</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Would that my address to young men could
be in a happier and more joyous tone. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
life has such a tragic side to multitudes in
our epoch, that I am compelled to deal with
the causes of this failure and misery. It is
imperative that the ground be cleared of the
hinderances before I can offer, in subsequent
lectures, the stimulus and encouragement.
One other reflection, therefore, on account
of its infinite import, I am bound to present.
This brief existence of yours, my brother, is
giving the coloring to immortality. The endless
life beyond the grave will take its character
from what you are now. You are the
child of eternity; you have now your time of
probation; you have your one earthly life to
live, and upon what you make it will depend
all that will follow through the ages of immortality.
Every sinful habit you form here
may cling like a leprosy to the soul there;
every depraved passion you nourish here
may perpetuate its black defilement there.
“The child is father to the man,” saith the
proverb. A young man of sense knows that
he will be as a master what he made himself
as an apprentice; and as a man, what he
made himself as a youth. He knows, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
that character is not built up by one or two,
but by the constant series of actions. So the
daily thoughts and acts of your earthly life
are forming your character for the vast existence
of which you are an heir, and which lies
beyond the grave.</p>

<p>The late Archbishop Whately, in some annotations
on Lord Bacon’s second essay, has
mentioned a very remarkable phenomenon
connected with insect-life, and has recorded
that it often occurred to him as a very
impressive analogy of a future state. You
know that every butterfly—the Greek name
for which, it is remarkable, is the same that
signifies also the soul, Psyche—comes from
a caterpillar—in the language of naturalists,
called a larva, which signifies, literally, a
mask. Now there is a tribe of insects called
ichneumon-flies, which inhabit and feed on
these larvæ. The parasitical flies have a long,
sharp sting, which pierces the body of the caterpillar,
and whereby they deposit their eggs
on the inward parts of their victim. But,
strange to say, the caterpillar thus attacked
goes on feeding, and apparently thriving quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
as well as those that have escaped. But
when the period arrives for the close of the
larva-life, then the evil is made manifest.
Caterpillars assume the pupa-state from which
they emerge butterflies; and it is then that
the difference appears between those that
have escaped the parasites and those that
were the victims of them. Beautiful and
awful analogy! There are many who, as to
the outside, look like other men. They dress
well, look well. The sin is preying only on
their immortal part; and when they have
laid aside that which merely belonged to
their physical life, then the soul shall stand,
with all its poverty and scars and shrivelled
places, naked and open. “The kingdom of
heaven is within you,” said Christ to his followers;
and so are the elements of hell in
other men.</p>

<p>Prodigious is the inconsistency of some
modern reasoners. They believe in the immortality
of the soul. They see that the
man is the development of the boy, and that
the acts of the youth leave their impress on
the whole after-life. They say law is inflexible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and that miracles therefore are impossible.
They affirm that justice is so exact that
its penalty must fall on its proper victim, and
that therefore Christ’s death is not vicarious.
But somehow at this point all their reasoning
falls to pieces. According to them, man in
the future life is not to be dealt with after
this inflexibility of law and this exactness of
justice. According to them, up to the moment
of death law goes in a straight, unbending
line; why then, in the name of all pretence
of reason, does it fail at that point, so
that wickedness, which has met with its exact
punishment in this world, fails to meet with
it in that coming one? Dear young man,
fearlessness as to what that future may be is
stark madness. It is folly for which there is
no name, for a man all through his earthly
life to bear the traces of the indolence and
self-willedness of his youth. But oh, what
must it be for all the future and eternal life
to bear the traces of the wrongs that have
been done to the soul in this? What must it
be for all the possible features with which the
soul entered on this life—truth, purity, love,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
faith—not only to have lain undeveloped, but
to have been quenched? Let me conjure and
entreat you to look at this subject. Do not,
for the sake of all that is dear to you, close
your eyes to it. Let the great future take its
right place as you are starting in life. Be
assured that the language of Scripture concerning
those that have perished is prompted
by God’s yearning for your immortal well-being,
while it accords with all the analogies
of creation: “For that they hated knowledge,
and did not choose the fear of the Lord,
<em>therefore shall they eat the fruit of their own way,
and be filled with their own devices</em>.”</p>

<p>Come then, young men, and let me persuade
you to a worthy view of life. God
meets you as you read these words, and offers
to be the guide of your human life. The
good God did not send you into his creation
to be afterwards an accursed thing in the
outer darkness. This life of yours, with its
endowments and capabilities, may become a
sublime and influential life—a blessed ascendency,
a tower of strength to men, regnant in
all that is majestic, angelic, and godlike.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Hear how Divine counsel speaks to you:
“How long, ye simple ones, will ye love folly?
Turn you at my reproof: <em>behold, I will pour
out my Spirit upon you; I will make known my
words unto you</em>.” Nor will life thus passed
be too earnest to be happy. Yours will be
the happiness—not of animal enjoyments
merely, not purchased with stabbing your
self-respect, not followed with the heart-sobs
of those who love you, but of one who is bringing
into use the higher and diviner faculties
of your nature. Your intelligence will be fed
by knowledge, your soul will be ennobled by
purity, your tastes will be in harmony with
sweet sounds and beauty, your conscience
will be kept in peace, and your heart’s emotions
will have play in ways that leave no
bitterness, but ofttimes swell into rapture.
Believe me, the only thing that can give
meaning and glory to your life is, to resolve
most resolutely that you will not be enslaved,
will not be degraded, will not be plunged into
the mire and foulness of sin, but will live according
to a life-plan of real nobleness. Remember,
no one can do this for you. Your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
life is in your own hands; and God has so
placed you among creatures, that <em>He</em> will not
do you saving good <em>without your consent</em>. You
may be a poor waif on the winds of temptation,
drifted to whatever abyss of destruction
they hurry you; or you may be a son of God,
victorious over sin, ranking with the earth’s
great ones, and followed with blessings. And
then, and then, when the final issue comes,
and you lie down to die, instead of regrets,
yours may be the solid satisfaction that your
life, from its very morning, has been consecrated
to the side of goodness; and then, instead
of a place with the wicked and the scorners,
you may go into a heaven for which you are
prepared, and into a life of glorious felicity
that is to come, and into which you have
been initiated down here.</p>

<p>Blessed be God, there is a short way to the
life I recommend. There are two steps by
which you may enter it. Obtain, first, forgiveness
for the sins of the past. God offers
you all the merits of Christ’s atoning sacrifice.
Through that great sacrifice he will
receive you, and <em>remember</em> your sins no more.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
In the blessed book, in every variety of form,
in every glowing and rich expression, are you
assured that pardon shall be granted to a
repentant soul. Young man, this is the first
step. Believe, and drop your burden of the
sins of the past. Start a free man.</p>

<p>This is the second step: offer your life
gratefully, lovingly, to the Friend and Saviour
of your soul. Ask for his Spirit to help
you: his ear will be swift to hearken. This
love to him will make his yoke easy, will
make the cross light, will make life to have
a magnificent meaning, will make sorrow to
wear a friendly guise, will break the force of
temptation, will make sin the hateful thing.
This will cause your feet to find “peace and
pleasantness” on the path of life, till you
reach the mansions where the golden gates
shall be thrown open for you, and the angels
shall tell you they have been waiting to welcome
you.</p>

<p>Brother, will you try this life?</p>

HOW YOU MAY SOLVE THEM.</h3>

</div>

<p>My object in this address is, to relieve the
doubts on religious subjects which meet a
young man on setting out in life. Such doubts
have been very common. Nor is it to be
wondered at. With some, to doubt is constitutional.
They are not able to give easy
credence to any tidings. With others, the
very stupendousness of religious subjects
causes the mind to pause in doubtfulness;
the revelations of Christianity are so transcendent,
that thought wavers before their
very grandeur. There may be doubt, yet
again, from those appalling miseries of human
life which it is the mission of Christianity
to heal; and no less from the strangely
unchristian lives of Christian men. All such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
doubts are to be treated tenderly. There
are thousands of such doubters among young
men at this hour; and they are not to be
denounced, but helped.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you will, I trust, agree
with me, that there is a pretence of doubting
which is the simple outgrowth of flippant
indifference or conceit. We hear Tennyson
quoted, that there “lives more faith in honest
doubt, than that in half the creeds.” Let
me, however, remind you, that Mr. Tennyson
did not mean <em>resting</em> in doubt; he meant an
“honest doubt,” that was bent upon inquiry,
and was open to conviction. He therefore
speaks in this same passage of one:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He fought his doubts, and gathered strength;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He would not make his judgment blind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He faced the spectres of his mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And laid them: thus he came at length</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To find a stronger faith his own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And power was with him in the night</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which makes the darkness and the light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dwells not in the light alone.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Observe, a great character is not built up
by doubting. There is weakness, not strength,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
in doubts. Nor is it necessarily a mark of
intelligence to doubt. Any scanty mind may
doubt, just as a fool may hold a penny-piece
to his eye, and say he has hidden the sun.
On the subject of Christianity, there is a very
common mistake which I would guard you
against. Christian faith is not a mere assent
to an orthodox creed; not a mere acceptance
of a speculative system of opinion. Christian
faith is a thing of will, of ingenuousness,
of candor, and of loyalty. The unbelief that
will be visited with judgment at the last day
is, the wilful, stubborn, uncandid, prevaricacious,
unpersuadable unbelief. Easiness of
temper does not make a just man; no more
does easiness of credence make a believing
man.</p>

<p>Conceiving then that you are honestly anxious
to arrive at truth, I will endeavor in this
address to meet some of the difficulties which
once perplexed my own mind. <em>The being of
God</em>, or the mystery attaching to the Divine
existence, not unnaturally disturbs the mind
upon the very threshold of religious inquiry.
Assuredly a God eternal, all-knowing, and everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
present is a mystery; but to stand
in the midst of a universe with endless marks
of a designing hand, and to say there is no
God, would be a greater and more appalling
mystery. Lord Bacon says: “I had rather
believe all the fables of the Talmud and Koran
than that this universal frame is without
a mind.” May you not exaggerate this difficulty?
Have you not the image of God in
nature? Look at the light of the sun. It
sends its rays through every cottage, every
stream, and over every living thing, and yet
it never contracts a stain, and takes no soil.
It awakens the germs of life in organic nature,
and they emerge in an endless variety
of forms; it clothes the forests with a robe of
verdure, paints the fields with countless flowers,
and calls forth the song of thousands of
birds. It unchains from their icy bands the
mountain-snows, and sends myriad rills to
make music through the valleys. It makes
the gladness of childhood, and cheers the
gloom of age. At the same time, it can photograph
every mental emotion and every
change of moral feeling. No subtlety can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
deceive it; it pierces beyond the false look;
it images the character with startling justice.
It is no labor to the sun to do this. Endow
this sun with mind; conceive that its rays
not only pervade and photograph every object,
but do so consciously. Have you not
here an emblem of Him who takes this image
of light?</p>

<p>Let me, my friend, guard you against the
young man who whispers in your ear that he
does not believe in God. You will mostly
find one of two things—either that the creed
of the atheist has been adopted by him without
two hours’ reflection on the matter, or is
an after-thought to make him comfortable in
sin. How unreasonable would a man appear
to you who should have come home from the
Paris exhibition of industry, affirming that
the edifice itself, its pictures, fountains, and
manifold products were the falling together
of chance, or self-developed. But he would
be wise in comparison with the man who
should see the myriad proofs of design in
the atmosphere, the soils, the foliage, and
his own frame, and affirm that there was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Almighty Designer. Out of ten thousand
proofs equally remarkable, let me mention
one or two. Think of the egg of a bird, so
made that wherever it is placed the chick
shall float uppermost, so as to be near the
warm bosom of its mother. Think of the
adaptation of the camel to its life in the desert.
Its feet, not like the hoofs of a horse,
but cushioned with elastic pads, that do not
sink into the sand, but spread over it; its
stomach set round with water-sacs, from the
supplies of which it can journey for days
without coming to fresh water; its eyes overhung
with eyebrows, and nostrils that can be
firmly closed, whereby it is not incommoded
with either the hot sand-clouds or the glare
of the desert. Think of a gulf-stream, sixty
miles broad and three thousand feet deep,
which comes from the tropics every winter,
which secures an equable temperature for the
fishes, and prevents the seas at Stockholm
and Norway from becoming a block of ice.
While this is so, there is a polar current
which rises in Greenland, and hastens to cool
the tropics. These are single evidences of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
design out of millions. And these myriad
evidences in the heavens and earth, in every
bird and insect, every flowering shrub and
blade of grass justify the assertion that a
man is a “fool” who says there is no God.
I indeed admit to you that, to men oppressed
with sin and darkness, it is difficult to know
and trust God as the Creator. His immeasurable
vastness seems to place him far from
us; but I shall soon show to you that God is
made known to his creatures through Christ.
He who has not thought it unworthy to unfold
to man in the heavens the magnificence
of his works, has not thought it unworthy of
himself to win back his creatures’ obedience
and love by sending his Son as a man. Christ
has interpreted God to us. We understand
God in him. We know how to seek him, to
find him, to trust him, to love him.</p>

<p>After the existence of God, that of <em>an immortal
spirit</em>, possessed by every human being,
lies at the basis of all religion. The argument
would be too metaphysical to prove here the
immortality of the soul. I can only suggest
to you one or two considerations. There has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
been a universal consent among the wisest
philosophers of all times and nations, that
the soul remains after the body. “The consent
of all,” said Cicero on this subject, “is
the voice of nature.” Observe also, that it is
by the soul we know of the existence of a universe.
All sensation is the recognition of
effects on our senses, but that recognition is
through consciousness or mind. Note also,
that the body changes, but the spirit remains.
A man may lose his hands or eyes, and the
loss may have no effect whatever on the soul.
Consider again, that matter never perishes.
If there is one axiom in philosophy that is
certain, it is this, that while particles of matter
may pass into new combinations, they
never cease to have existence. You may
well, then, ask with Dr. Young:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">“Can it be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Matter immortal, and shall spirit die?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above the nobler shall less noble rise?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall man alone, for whom all else revives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No resurrection know? Shall man alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imperial man, be sown on barren ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Less privileged than grain on which he feeds?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>Observe once more on this subject, there
are manifold proofs that the soul has in this
state only the dawn of its being. The animals
reach perfection in a few years but
men, at death, are only beginning to use
their faculties. The principle of thought,
reason, and hope within them has here only
glimpses, outreachings, and aspirations of a
higher life. Are not these yearnings, this
sense of incompleteness, prophecies of a future
life? Our lives here are not the tones
of perfect harmony, but rather like stringed
instruments being attuned for celestial melody.
And, alas, what inequalities, what sufferings,
what wrongs have some to endure
here that <em>require</em> another state for vindication
and rectification also! If, therefore,
you find one argument against the immortality
of the soul, you will readily find a hundred
for it.</p>

<p>A further source of doubt is, <em>a false impression
respecting holy scripture</em>. You may have
thought that the Bible, being called a revelation
from God, would be like a book written
in heaven, and altogether different from human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
works. But, in infinite wisdom and
mercy, this has not been God’s mode of
revelation. He has condescended to reveal
his mind through the history, the follies, the
virtues, the sins, and struggles of men. This
history is both human and superhuman. It
is human, for the men who wrote it carried
into it the peculiarities of their age and their
culture. It is superhuman, for it truly and
faithfully tells the dealings of God with the
first races of men, and afterwards through
Christ.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament history you have
records of men who lived in an earlier and
ruder period of humanity; but the writing or
the compilation of these records has been
controlled so as to teach the awfulness of
sin, the safety of righteousness, and the faithfulness
of Jehovah. Dreadful is it to be told
of the incest of Lot; but it is merciful that
we have a justification of the warnings against
the licentious nations of Moab and Ammon,
whose origin is thus narrated. It is painful
to follow the history of Saul, but it is merciful
that we have such a vivid picture of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
miserable fruits of a self-love that poisoned
otherwise noble impulses. Through all the
records of men in the Old Testament, you are
taught, as in the life of Jacob, that every
wrong act has a seed of evil in it, whose bitter
fruits the doer has to eat, and that God’s
providence is perpetually controlling the good
and the evil for the education of men and of
nations.</p>

<p>Look at the book of Psalms, the liturgy of
prayers and praises for all ages, the sacred
ballads for humanity. There is much that is
human in these Psalms; but if God had sent
down to us songs composed by the angels,
they would have been valueless by the side
of those in this incomparable book. While I
am in this world of fierce temptation, of suffering,
and of moral weakness, what I want
is, not so much angelic musings and raptures,
as the prayers of a man tempted, struggling,
suffering, fallen as I am; and yet a man ever
reaching with such sobs of penitence and intense
heart-cries after God. I mourn David’s
sin and sufferings, but I feel grateful that the
Scriptures have preserved to me his Psalms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
which interpret the fiercest beatings of my
heart, the lowliest confessions of my moral
besetments, and the deepest aspirations of
my nature.</p>

<p>Look again at the epistles of the New
Testament: you have here the records of
churches which fell, some into one error,
others into another. But these errors are
such as are common to humanity. Admirable,
therefore, is the wisdom whereby inspired
doctrines and consolations are conveyed, not
in any abstract method, but in their relation
to the very tendencies of our nature. Your
objection, therefore, to the Bible, that it is so
human, is from an utterly mistaken impression
of the mode in which revelation could
be best made to men, and from forgetfulness
of its deep, profound, and most precious
adaptation to human life.</p>

<p>And here I cannot help adverting to the
moral unfairness of infidelity. In a recent
conference of working-men, one of them told
the meeting that the history of the fall of
man, in the second chapter of Genesis, was
so improbable that he rejected all which came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
after. Perhaps the narrative is improbable
to a mind intensely literal, unused to eastern
modes of thought, and which cannot find the
truth under those partially allegorical representations
which most effectually teach the
vast bulk of the human race. The same objections
are urged against the sun standing
still in the book of Joshua, and to the history
of Jonah. I am not going to reply to these
objections. Infidels do not want a reply.
If they did, they would find scores. But
what shall be said of the candor of a man
who, because of such objections, rejects the
Old Testament, which abounds in passages
of the tenderest sympathy for the poor and
for the suffering, which demands the most
exact rectitude between man and man, and
which taught a morality in those early days
to which there is nothing at all approaching
in the annals of Egypt, Greece, and Rome?
Let me recommend you to turn to Leviticus
19:9, 10; Deuteronomy 24:13, 19-22.</p>

<p>See how the slavery of the nations was
mitigated among the Hebrews by the enforcement
of the principle—which the Grecian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and Roman law denied—that it was the
duty of the master to treat his servants as
men, to instruct them in his own religion,
and to count them members of his household.
Shame on men who have in the Bible such
consideration for the toilers and such rebukes
of oppressors, but who ignore all this, and
hold up the Old Testament to scorn because
of one or two difficulties to <em>their</em> understanding.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Nothing so loudly proclaims that such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
infidelity is not a thing of “honest” doubt,
but of a bad mind and of a bad heart. Difficulties
there are in the Bible. I have studied
most of those difficulties, and confess with
gratitude that they have one by one disappeared.
This I doubt not will be the case
with them all. But to me it seems that I
should deserve the contempt of man and the
indignation of my Maker, if because of these
difficulties, in times so remote and in usages
so different from modern customs, I set aside
the book which tells me of God’s profound
interest in my race, which reveals my relation
to a spiritual world, which has purified
the lives and pacified the consciences of millions,
and which has made just and considerate
their treatment of others.</p>

<p><em>Miracles</em> which bear witness to divine revelations
are made an occasion for doubt by some.
Let us examine this objection candidly. Why
are miracles not believed? “<em>They contradict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
experience.</em>” A few years ago M. Boutigny,
at a meeting of the British Association, caused
ice to be produced from a red-hot crucible.
Surely this contradicted experience. “<em>They
are incredible to reason.</em>” So is the fact that
the sea once covered the beds of sea-shells on
the tops of the highest mountains. “<em>The
enemies of Jesus attributed miracles to magic.</em>”
The very proof they were wrought; else they
would have denied the facts, and not resorted
to this pretence. “<em>They are impossible, for
they suspend inflexible laws of nature.</em>” To
this modern objection I reply, there are no
laws of the universe except the direct agency
of God. If, then, he interposes to arrest a
subject-law, there is no suspension of the law
of nature; the supreme law is still in operation.
For example: By the inflexible law of
gravitation, a ball dropped from the top of a
tower falls to the earth. But suppose a man
catches it in his hand, is the law of gravitation
suspended? Not at all. A controlling
law is brought into operation, to which, that
law is obedient. Thus you have the agency
of God in miracles. Do not, I implore you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
be swayed by writers who find it the easiest
of all things to multiply objections when they
are utterly indifferent about finding replies.
Remember that in the first ages miracles must
have been worked, else Christianity, with the
tremendous sacrifices it demanded, could not
have gained a footing in the earth, much less
have changed the religion of the Roman empire.
Gibbon tried his strength to dispute
this, but never did a man so signally fail.</p>

<p>An exaggerated estimate of the <em>strength of
literary skepticism</em> has been another source of
doubt in these days. There are three writers
especially to whom this remark applies. The
first is Dr. Colenso. He was believed to be
a learned theological scholar. Never was an
estimate more false; never did a more pedantic
theologian take pen in hand. What pretensions
had such a man to be a guide, who
more recently tried to prove that there were
no accredited prayers to Christ in the Bible,
nor in the Prayer-book, nor in the Presbyterian
Psalter? Thirty-four instances of direct
prayer to Christ were at once pointed
out in the Psalter; more than twelve prayers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to the Saviour were quoted as sanctioned by
apostolic practice in the New Testament, and
passages of prayer to the “Lamb of God”
were appealed to in the Liturgy. If young
men are to doubt, let not a literary blunderer
like this have weight with them. At the time
that the bishop of Natal’s work came out, a
gentleman was commiserated on the alleged
overthrow of the Bible. “The Scriptures
will be extinguished now,” said the man of
the world. The shrewd Yorkshireman replied:
“Well, you see I have lived long
enough to hear many prophecies of this nature;
but the extinguisher has always been
a wooden one, which the light has burnt
through.” My friend’s figure has remarkably
come true. Dr. Colenso had a reputation
as an arithmetician; but this has well
nigh gone, and his theological books are
marked sixpence on back book-stalls.</p>

<p>In like manner have the two other critics
failed to get into the world’s thought. Some
years ago, Dr. Strauss sent forth a so-called
“Life of Jesus.” The greater part of the
gospel narratives were resolved into myths.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
More recently another edition came out, and
facts which in the first edition were called
fabulous were now given as veritable history.
Is the “critical faculty” of such a man a safe
guide to young men?</p>

<p>Later still, M. Renan, acknowledging that
it was impossible to doubt the substantial
genuineness of the gospels and the Acts of
the Apostles, presumed to patronize Christ
and Christianity. And what was his conclusion?
Do not start when I tell you: The
Frenchman professes to believe that thousands
of the most bigoted Jews, and of enlightened
Greeks and Romans, renounced the
venerable institutions of their fathers and
embraced a religion which demanded the
severest sufferings and sacrifices, because a
woman under a love-spell of hallucination
had <em>fancied</em> she had seen a young Galilean
rabbi alive who was really dead! Just conceive
what would now be the effect on Europe
of a new religion whose fundamental fact
had such puerile support. Why was it different
on educated Romans? Do not say I
am deceiving you when I tell you that M.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Renan professes to believe that the apostle
Paul abandoned prejudice, station, privilege,
prospects, and braved scorn, appalling sufferings,
and a martyr’s death, because he had
been frightened in a thunder-storm! Talk
about credulity, was there ever credulity like
this? Alas, what monstrous absurdities will
men believe rather than the plain testimony
of Scripture! Woe to the dupes of a literary
skepticism which changes its creed every five
years!</p>

<p>It may be in addressing you, my friend, on
the spirit of doubt which taints and enfeebles
this age, that you have been influenced by
what is deemed <em>the attitude of scientific men</em>
towards Christianity. A flagrant and most
mischievous impression is abroad that scientific
men in our times are infidels. Very confidently
do I affirm that it is not so. I have
attended meetings of learned societies in
London, and of the British Association in the
country, and have heard these meetings spoken
of as atheistic, when out of hundreds of
scientific men there were not a dozen whose
language could have justified such an imputation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Such distinguished leaders of science
as Professor Owen, Professor Phillips of Oxford,
and Sir Roderick Murchison, would
indignantly repudiate the charge of seeking
to undermine the faith of England in Christianity;
and in this they would have the
sympathy of an overwhelming majority of
scientific men in the British Isles. Your
danger is not so much in the facts science
has established, as in the false notions which
have been caught up of these facts. A scientific
discussion would be beside the object
of this address; but note these accordances
between one science and the Bible: Scripture
affirms the late date of man upon the
earth; so does geology—Sir C. Lyell says,
“No discovery has shaken our belief in the
extremely modern date of the human era.”
Scripture teaches that the world was once
covered by water; so does geology: “It is
concluded as a fundamental maxim in geology,”
says Professor Phillips, “that the
whole area now occupied by dry land was
once covered by sea.” Scripture teaches that
God made the dry land to appear; and geology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
affirms that the rocks, or dry land, have
been upheaved from the waters. Scripture
teaches that the beasts were created after
their kind; that is, each group made up of a
number of species; so does geology. The
Bible, written for an unscientific age, has
thus these marvellous agreements with science
in its most recent developments. You perhaps
hear of a solitary scientific mind tracing back
man to a sea-shell; but another says, “The
idea that a mollusk could become a fish, or
a lizard a man, is worthy only of a madman,
and gives but poor evidence of the progress
of civilization at the present time.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Indeed,
there is no utterance that looks adverse to
Scripture which is not met by a decided divergence
of opinion equally scientific.</p>

<p>Turn from these questionings to the history
of Jesus Christ as contained in the four
gospels. The most consummate learning of
the enemies of the faith cannot invalidate
these gospels. Their genuineness has borne
every critical test of the most advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
scholarship. The evidence for their absolute
truthfulness is immeasurably greater than
for the authenticity of any secular book
which the past has transmitted to us. You
believe that eight hundred years ago a conqueror
landed in England who abolished the
Saxon monarchy. On testimony better than
that for the belief in William the Conqueror
have you the fact confirmed to you, that
eighteen hundred years ago, in a strip of fair
and sunny land in Asia—a land which for
two thousand years had been the theatre of
events which marked it out as the scene for
some grand evolvement of historic import—there
appeared a Teacher from Galilee, just
rising into the maturity of manhood. He
unites in Himself the most unusual varieties
of character. He has vast intellect and the
tenderest sensibility; the calmest judgment
and the keenest feeling. He is lowly, but
always magnanimous; He is meek, and yet
majestic; He is most compassionate to human
frailty, but abhors human vice; He is
despised, but never fretted; insulted, but
never ruffled; never is He charged with sin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
yet by a strange and precious sympathy He
draws to Himself the sinful and the outcast.
He is essentially human; is found at the
marriage feast and the evening meal. He
speaks parables which childhood can understand,
and over which genius wonderingly
lingers. His teaching is so profound, wise,
and novel, that it for ever shades all the
teaching of the wise men of antiquity. He
did works which no other man had ever done.
He invited all heavy-laden ones to come to
him for rest, and announced that He was
“the Light of the world.” During a brief
ministry, over five hundred men and women
so believed in Him, that afterwards many of
them laid down their lives for His sake.
Very soon after His death upon the cross,
when he startled his enemies by the loud
cry, “It is finished,” a “<em>vast multitude</em>” in
Rome itself enrolled themselves as His disciples.
This fact comes to us on the testimony
of the heathen historian Tacitus; and
Gibbon admits it must be received as unquestionably
genuine.</p>

<p>This Jesus Christ we affirm to be the Son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
of man and the Son of God. He is the Revealer
of God. He pierced to the core of
human misery, while he wielded the resources
of omnipotence; he wound about his
heart human sympathies, but now sits at the
right hand of God exalted. My brother, I
solemnly tell you that to refuse to believe in
Christ after the evidence afforded will violate
your candor, will trample on the rectitude of
your reasoning, and will bring on you consequences
which you will eternally deplore. I
cannot utter words that deserve comparison
with those of Christ himself: “I am come
a light into the world, that whosoever believeth
in me should not abide in darkness.”
“He that rejecteth me hath one that judgeth
him: the word that I have spoken, the same
shall judge him in the last day.”</p>

<p>You may ask, Can a man be lost for <em>sincere</em>
doubt? If a man clings to this doubt, if he
will not candidly inquire, if he refuses to receive
testimony, he will be lost; not because
of his doubt, but because of his obstinacy.
This talk of sincere doubting is often very
unreasonable talk. A man may sincerely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
doubt whether it is well to sow corn in the autumn
or spring, and he may sow his fields in
July; but his sincerity will not save him from
bankruptcy or the workhouse. A schoolboy
may sincerely doubt the necessity of learning
Euclid, history, and geography—he may refuse
the testimony of wiser heads; but his
sincerity will not save him from going into
mercantile or professional life a dunce, and
the chances are that he will rue his so-called
sincere doubt to the end of his days.
You, my brother, will soon pass into a world
shrouded with impenetrable darkness. There
is but one voice which can tell you of a way
whereby your spirit hereafter may reach a
region of light and felicity. Should you close
your ear to that voice, and nurse your doubts,
and refuse to investigate, then let me tell you
that there can be nothing for you at the last
day but “shame and everlasting contempt.”</p>

<p>Observe also, if you want demonstration
that will overbalance all difficulties, you will
never find it. In the affairs of this life men
act on the <em>preponderance</em> of evidence. If
there should appear twenty reasons for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
course of action and only five against it, he
would be reckoned a fool who became swayed
by the five, and refused to inquire further.
In mercantile life, the men who will never
decide and act till they have reasons which
exclude all doubt, are left behind in the progress
of society, and become the poor and despised.
Your condition in this world is a
test whether you will be true and docile. If
you want light, there is abundance to guide
you; if you choose darkness, God will not
compel your belief.</p>

<p>I remind you, again, that no man has ever
grown wise or good, or left a permanent
impression on his age, as a doubter. The
heroes of all times have been men of faith.
Read the Book itself. The Bible is a locked
treasure to prejudice, but it never fails to
satisfy candor. As you stand outside one of
our ancient cathedrals, and look up at its
chancel window, all looks cold, unmeaning,
and uninteresting. But, as has been well
said, when on a sunny morning you have
entered that chancel, “how changed is that
window! It is now gorgeous in beauty, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
glows with life. Cold and dreary outside, it
is warm and radiant within. Instead of being
incomprehensible and obscure, it is full of
meaning and glorious harmony?” Such is
the difference between reading the Bible as a
doubter or as a critic, and going to it as one
interested in its contents and willing to be
taught.</p>

<p>Follow for a moment the course of two
young men. Your acquaintance will supply
the sketch readily. See one coming in the
morning from the chamber where he has
looked with affection and trust into the face
of his Saviour; has supplicated strength to
meet the day’s duties and temptations; and
has pondered the words, “Wherewithal shall
a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
thereto according to thy word.” He enters
the family circle to meet the mother’s smile,
a brother’s greeting, and a sister’s cheery
welcome. His father, with proud joy, consults
him as an equal. He is a firm link in
the family chain of happiness. See him as
he stands on the floor of the warehouse with
uprightness. The tricky trader, when he cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
cheat him, respects his honor. He chooses
friendships that are elevating. No profane
scorner walks by his side; no impure profligate
soils the atmosphere of his home. He
spends his evenings amid cheerful enjoyments,
ennobling elevations, or useful ameliorations.</p>

<p>Contrast the other. He rises from a prayerless
bed; drags down stairs his wearied frame
at the latest possible moment; the older
members of the family have gone off to their
several duties. As for him, the debauch of
the last night makes every thing wrong: the
coffee is thick; the servant slow; the very
cat’s quietness upon the hearth irritates him,
and with a kick he relieves his pent-up discontent.
To his mother he is rude; the
younger children have scampered away at
his approach, saying their “big brother is so
sulky.” The clock sounds; he is off to business.
The whole day he is confused and
hindered by the remembrance of the last
night’s pollution, or the planning for the coming
evening’s pleasure. When the evening
has come, he goes where he will degrade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
young women in a way which would arouse
his direst indignation should another do the
same to his sister; or he enters scenes where
he would die with shame if his mother or sister
could follow him. And this is the young
man whose law is a miserable and hateful
selfishness, or who on a Sunday afternoon
reads an infidel book for five minutes, and
then says, “Ah, I knew the Bible was false,
and Christians all hypocrites.” Poor pitiable
wretch! as if the judgment of such a man
was of the slightest value against Scripture.</p>

<p>And observe, the end will come. A nurse
very recently was summoned to a sick-bed
in Paris. The invalid was a young Englishman.
Before she would enter upon her duties,
she asked if the sufferer was a Christian.
Upon being answered in the affirmative, she
said: “I have seen such horrible sights, and
heard such wailings in the dying chambers
of ungodly and dissolute men, that I dare not
now undertake to nurse another such a one.”
Tronchan, in his memoirs of Voltaire, says:
“I wish that those who had been perverted
by his writings had been present at his death.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
It was a sight too horrid to witness.” These
are awful facts and foreshadowings after a
life of infidel pleasure.</p>

<p>Let me add a test of your sincerity. One
of the most accomplished and gifted of authoresses
has told us that dark doubts on
divine subjects once shrouded her spirit. As
she looked up at midnight to the vault of the
heavens, and saw the stars moving in serenity
and order, the thought came over her
troubled spirit, “The Creator of those orbs
must take an interest in me, his rational
creature. I hold to nothing but a dim hope
of his existence. I will take my dark mind
to him, and ask him for light. Prayer shall
be with me the ‘<em>test of truth</em>.’” To that sincere
cry the answer came. Her heart, intellect,
and conscience, found rest in Christ; the
Bible became to her an exhaustless fount of
wisdom; in mathematical culture and in musical
taste she became distinguished, and her
life became signally useful. Two eminent
men were lifted out of their doubts by the
promise in Luke 11:13. “If the Bible be
true,” they reasoned, “the Lord will give his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Spirit to them that ask him. We will put
this promise to the proof.” The one—John
Newton—became the most influential preacher
of the gospel in the British metropolis;
the other—William Wilberforce—became one
of the best, most useful, and most honored of
statesmen.</p>

<p>My brother, let this be the test of your
sincerity. Will you earnestly and perseveringly
ask God to fulfil this promise in you?</p>

<p>I shall close this address with twelve articles,
which may be termed <span class="smcap">the creed of the
infidel</span>.</p>

<p>1. That Book is to him an imposture and
pretended revelation, which furnishes the
only explanation ever offered of human misery,
suffering, and death; which responds to
man’s universal craving for immortality, and
throws the clearest light upon a future state;
which presents the sublimest views of the
compassion of the Creator; which paints a
picture of man which has had an exact transcript
in the history of all nations, and on
behalf of which myriads rise up to testify
that it has been a ceaseless impulse to aspirations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
a comfort in their trials, and has
taken away the fear of death.</p>

<p>2. He believes that the earlier narratives
of the Bible were fabrications intended to
glorify the Jewish nation: but somehow
these fabrications are totally unlike the legendary
traditions of Greece and Rome; for
instead of making their ancestors gods and
heroes, they make them slaves, and tell a history
of Jacob and his sons which covers their
progenitors with infamy; and strange to say,
these fabrications imposed upon later prophets,
who were the sternest denouncers of falsehood,
and are now imposing upon six millions
of Jews, who, with a tenacity unparalleled
and sacrifices ceaseless, cling to the
ritual and history of their ancestors.</p>

<p>3. He believes that by some unaccountable
species of literary deception, unlettered or
fanatical men have pretended to give four
narratives of the founder of Christianity,
which the greatest modern critics confess are
“the very gold of simplicity, integrity, and
truthfulness,” and which present an image of
Jesus Christ that brings most vividly into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
view the very perfection of humanity, that
has furnished a model for the noblest spirits
among men, and that surpasses in beauty
and grandeur all that poetry ever sung of
human genius ever conceived.</p>

<p>4. He believes that the writers of the New
Testament were either knaves or fools; and
yet they taught the purest, wisest, most elevated,
and most self-sacrificing system of
morals the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>5. He believes that in the most enlightened
and skeptical age of the Roman Empire, thousands
of men were such arrant fools as to give
credence to a history of Christ which was full
of lies, and to a record of miracles which had
never been worked, and this at a time so near
to the events, that an imposture could not
have escaped detection for an hour.</p>

<p>6. He believes that “a vast multitude” of
Romans, Greeks, and Jews deserted, for a
fanatical superstition, the splendid temples
of their fathers, the schools of philosophy of
which they had been proud, and the religion
of their ancestors, which had been enriched
by the grandest historical associations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>7. He believes that the early propagators
of Christianity, and the believers in it, acted
altogether contrary to ordinary motives of
weak or bad men; they embraced a creed
which, instead of gaining them aught, exposed
them to the most diabolical cruelties,
and held to their testimony in the face of tortures,
banishment, and a shameful death.</p>

<p>8. He believes that, although Christianity
is a lying system of priestism or fanaticism,
it nevertheless, according to irrefutable testimony,
abolished the ferocious deeds of the
amphitheatre, overthrew the horrid rites of
paganism, introduced an era of benevolence,
and marked a new starting-point of progress
for the human race.</p>

<p>9. He believes that twelve obscure, penniless
Jews, with a higher wisdom than was
claimed by Socrates, Cicero, or Plato, taught
the only religion which has been proved to
be adapted to every country and every condition
of man on the surface of the wide
globe.</p>

<p>10. He believes that the Christian Sabbath,
or the weekly seventh-day rest, is an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
institution indispensable to the present physical
condition of men and animals; that without
it modern civilization would bring to myriads
of men and beasts unbroken toil, disease,
and premature death; but that this seventh-day
rest is a purely human institution,
having come, he scarcely knows how, from
men who were foisting on the world false and
illiterate traditions under the name of divine
revelations.</p>

<p>11. He believes that the writings of the
Christian Scriptures, although an ill-constructed
collection of falsehoods, have never
been proved false by the subtlest ingenuity
of their enemies, but have been most firmly
held to be true by men of the profoundest
intellect, of the most resolved and persevering
investigation—the very scholars, thinkers,
and master-spirits of humanity, such as
Newton, Bacon, Milton, Boyle, Locke, Pascal,
Davy, Chalmers, and a host besides.</p>

<p>12. He believes that those great nations of
Europe which are immensely in advance of
all the nations of antiquity, and of all the
heathen and Mohammedan nations of Asia at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
this time, and which are distinguished for
their liberty, wealth, culture, arts, schools,
asylums, charity, and beneficence, have become
so while under the sway of a miserable
system of religious superstition, which a few
unlettered fanatics palmed upon the world
eighteen centuries ago.</p>

<p>Skeptic, is this thy creed? Then, O man,
great is thy credulity!</p>

<p>Trifler, who callest the Bible “weak folly,”
take heed! thy despising of Christianity may
be shown to be thy folly and culpable weakness,
which will have to be deplored by thee
for ever.</p>

<p>My doubting brother, you may turn the
tables when reproached with the beliefs of
Christians, and point to the absurdities involved
in <span class="smcap">the credulity of infidelity</span>.</p>

<p>Although it is perfectly true that we may
so exalt our importance as individuals as to
feed self-conceit; although as a rule men
think they have more talents than they really
possess, it is nevertheless certain that there
is not one man in ten who makes the most of
himself for the purpose for which he was created.
The great waste of life is wasted or
perverted power. What noble youths come
out of schools and colleges; how few afterwards
make their lives noble. With what
opportunities do many enter upon business
and professions, and afterwards sink into the
grave with scarcely a trace to indicate that
they ever lived. There have been hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
who could have rivalled the patriotism of
Hampden, or the humanity of Howard, or
the eloquence of Chatham, and who have
left behind them no one memorial of their
existence. It is recorded that a fellow-student
once said to Paley: “You are a great
fool to waste your best years in the dissipations
of a university; you have talents for
something better.” To multitudes of gifted
young men has the like thing been said, but
said in vain. Paley took the hint, which was
roughly given. And now “there is no name
in the English church that stands higher than
his, and no name in the vast circles of English
literature that has a more permanent
fame.”</p>

<p>The great things of this world have been
accomplished by individuals. Vast social
reformations have originated in individual
souls. Truths that now sway the world were
first proclaimed by individual lips. Great
thoughts, that now are the axioms of humanity,
proceeded from the centre of individual
hearts. No warlike host delivered the children
of Israel from the bondage of Egypt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
but one man—Moses. No senate of statesmen
raised Israel to a pitch of greatness that
proclaimed a theocratic nation to the world,
but one man—David. No school of divines
gave to England the Bible in the mother
tongue, but one man—Wyckliffe. No learned
society discovered America, but one man—Columbus.
No association of science revealed
the clue to interpret the laws of the universe,
but one man—Galileo. No parliament
saved English liberties, but one man—Pym.
No assembly of theologians wrote the book,
which nest to the Bible has had the most
potent influence on the English language and
on English hearts, but one man—John Bunyan.
No confederate nations rescued Scotland
from her distracted councils, from her
political and ecclesiastical enemies, but one
man—Knox. No chambers of commerce
taught Europe to abolish the restrictions of
trade, but one man—Richard Cobden. Doubtless
these men found their coadjutors; but all
through the ages God has put immense honor
upon individuals.</p>

<p>Young man, do not let others fashion what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
your life shall be. Thomas Carlyle says
somewhere that he would like to stop the
stream of people in the Strand, and ask every
man his history. But, “No,” says the sage,
“I will not stop them. If I did, I should
find they were like a flock of sheep following
in the track of one another.” Alas, men begin
to lose their individuality of conviction
the moment they step into the world. Here
is a young man beginning life’s business.
He feels, as he starts, an impulse to be pure
and noble. He is surrounded by clerks in an
office. A fortnight passes, and one evening,
when he is hurrying home after office hours,
he hears a fast young man whisper at the
desk, “Poor fellow, he’s off to be pinned to
his mother’s knee.” Now, what would be the
right thing for that youth to do? To say at
once, “Yes, and God forbid I should ever forget
what I owe to my mother.” Let him say
this, and the insulter would be shamed, if
shame were not dead. He would respect the
self-assertion of his fellow-clerk. Does the
new-comer say this? No; his ears turn red;
his face is suffused with a blush; and in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
night or two the poor weak one dares some
trick of folly to show his independence, and
to prove that home influences do not bind
him. Thus, alas!—how shall I say it sorrowfully
enough?—thus he makes a sacrifice of
his individuality on the altar that a profligate
clerk has built up for him; and then, step by
step, he weaves around himself the bonds of
pleasure, till, amid the dark storm of shipwrecked
character, blasted reputation, wrung
hearts at home, worn-out health, and miserable
self-reproaches, he sinks to his unhonored
grave, leaving only a memory of disgrace to
those who have loved him.</p>

<p>I have known many a young man who has
seen the right path as plain as noonday. God
has mercifully flashed clear conviction of duty
upon him. No mental mistake has hindered
him. His judgment has been convinced; his
feelings have been moved; he has felt sure
that it would be better for him, for this life
and for the nest, to take a decided position
on the side of God and righteousness. And
what has hindered him? What has led to
waste and self-remorse? Has he been persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
by the wise? Has he been reasoned
out of his convictions by the influential? No;
he has been moved by the jeer of a dandy or
the sneer of the coquette; he has quenched
his conviction before the mocking taunt of
some empty-brained street lounger; has lowered
his own high tone of morals lest he should
seem <em>singular</em> in the little circle of worldly
society surrounding him. Do you say, “Can
a man set himself against society?” If society
quenches the true in you, if it binds you,
if it robs you of moral manhood, if it makes
you its slave, there can remain no question
to you as to what is your duty. Scorn to
degrade yourself by yielding up your individuality
to suit the whim of, it may be, the
worthless and vulgar.</p>

<p>You are stepping into life, where you will
find thousands who became vicious because
they never formed the resolve to live nobly.
Such men are the dead leaves that fall upon
the stream and flow, not by any vital power
or aim in themselves, but by the eddying
current around them. There is many a sot
who is imbruted, because he never determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
that he would not be a drunkard. There is
many a useless one who has become a cipher,
because he never resolved to give to his life
a meaning. There is many a filthy blasphemer
who is profane, because he never resolved
that the foul oath should not soil his lips.
There is many a defiled, polluted, and diseased
one, because he never resolved that he
would not be the companion of a whore. This
is the sorrowfulest of all things—men ruined,
sinking into sin, vulgarity, uselessness, vileness,
not because they intended to be bad,
but because they had not the courage to
resolve to be good.</p>

<p>It is yet more deeply to be lamented that
the young men who are thus ruined are mostly
the open, the generous, and the frank. A cold
nature that no one cares for, that is not wanted
in the drinking-room, or smoking-room, or
billiard-room, passes into manhood without
hurt; but good-natured and gleeful young
men have a weak side whereby they become
a prey to the dissipated. They are companionable
and sympathetic, therefore miscreants
suck them by temptation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>It would be grateful to our feelings if this
compromise of individual character were confined
to the men who disregard the claims of
virtue. It is by no means so. A philosophic
statesman, J. Stuart Mill, in his Essay on
Liberty, complains that no period of England’s
history has been so little marked by
individual originality and force as our own.
Certainly, whether we look upon the merely
moral or the professedly religious circles of
our country, we find everywhere the tendency
to sink the man in the crowd, the Christian in
the church. This shifting of personal responsibility
from the one to the many is the secret
alike of national and of individual ineffectiveness.
Only look around you, and you will
see hundreds who might assert for themselves,
and for the cause of truth and philanthropy,
a position of dignity and power, who are hindered
by the maxims and habits of others.</p>

<p>There is a prevailing impression that it is
women, with their quick sensibilities, who
are the most susceptible to the influences of
fashion and opinion. It admits of question
whether this prevailing weakness in our days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
is not on the side of young men. They do
not so much make manifest their subserviency,
but it is not the less deteriorating and
real. Take a few examples.</p>

<p>Here, in a select neighborhood, is a young
man who affects style. A place in the omnibus
would fit his limited means. But no;
the omnibus is all very well for men whose
position is made, and for young fellows who
have no standing in society; but for him, a
horse and groom must form a part of his appointments.
So he burdens himself, or speculates,
or runs into debt, that horse or “trap”
may be at command. And thus he, who by
manly independence, and an expenditure
according with his circumstances, could have
risen to be honored and esteemed, shrinks
away at length into some lower neighborhood,
or drags out a vexed and discontented
life, because he has forgotten the honor
which he might have commanded at the outset,
had he lived out his honest conviction
and not made himself a mere imitator.</p>

<p>Or take other cases. Yon beardless youth
must smoke the, to him, nauseous cigar or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
meerschaum, because “Tom Grandeur” struts
down High-street, looking large behind his
curling smoke. Nay, “My Lord Meek,” who
cares no more for a hunt or race than the most
refined and timid lady, enlarges his stables,
buys a fine stud, makes up his book for the
St. Leger; or, with a sore heart, joins the
“throw off,” caring not a whit for the brush,
but very much that he may not be outdone in
his equipage or establishment. All through
society this abnegation of individuality weaves
its web. Nor is the effect circumscribed to
the frivolous and weak. Men think in cliques.
It is intolerable to some to be out of fashion
with the political opinion of their set. Never
was contradiction so contemptible as that into
which they are betrayed. It would be ludicrous,
were it not too serious an indication of
the want of principle. One month you hear
men denouncing a political opinion and its
prominent advocates, with all the vituperative
energy of which their nature is capable.
The next month, forsooth, they have adopted
that precise opinion, and eagerly rush to share
some leaf of the laurel which they hope will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
fall upon them through the tergiversation of
their party.</p>

<p>You have, alas, the same thing among so-called
religious men. Many a young man has
powers which would bless the church and the
world, but for his maudlin regard for what
others may think of him. He is, it may be, a
young man whose father’s religiousness gave
him universal sway in his town or neighborhood.
No workman but honored him; no
cottager but felt the sweetness of his sympathy.
The son of this great and good man is
thrown among Ritualists. This is the religious
fashion of the hour, and therefore it
fascinates him. He adopts it, not because he
is convinced of its truth, but because it suits
what he deems his “æsthetic taste.” Deplorably
ignorant of the past struggles of English
history, he is gratified with the crowded
churches in which he can witness this pictorial
religion of waving censers, purple-robed
priests, and picturesque altar arrangements.
He falls into the cant of saying that Protestantism
is “unsymbolical.” The white-robed
choristers and lighted candles respond to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
what he terms the “holy symbols” of the
faith. He begins now to think the religion
that made his home a very paradise, his wise
father a man of power, and his mother saintly,
is a very vulgar thing, and only inculcated
by unlettered men and unauthorized teachers.
And thus the poor soul excuses himself
from the demands of personal exertion and
personal fidelity to conscience; loses himself
in the easy externalisms or poetic dreamings
which secure him the favor of sentimental
pastors, and the smiles of young ladies with
pendant crosses on their breasts. It is pitiable,
but it is also sad, to think what ineffectiveness
of life comes to a young man who,
instead of being the dupe of weaklings, might
have allied himself with the grandest of Englishmen,
and left behind him records of abiding
influence.</p>

<p>There is no circle where a man can escape
this peril of being unduly swayed by others.
Many well-principled young men, who are
free from the follies I have glanced at, lose
their power to influence through a deplorable
lack of force. Instead of quickness, briskness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
strength, in the warehouse, they do their
work in a dreamy, sentimental way. Their
religious coterie is composed of people who
are slow, sedate, and lack vigor. They are
taught to think that religion consists in unctuous
prayers, sanctimonious looks, effusive
utterances, instead of a consistent filling up
of duty, care for their employers’ interest, and
faithful discharge of daily tasks. Oh, do not
forget it is the action, it is the life in the very
sphere which God has appointed, that is the
opportunity for the manifestation of religion.
All mere emotion is like the steam from the
engine—of no value except as an indication
of ability to work.</p>

<p>There is another danger. You will find a
class of religious men not at all sentimental,
but who will sneer at what they term religious
earnestness. A young man’s worst
enemies are often cold, formal, routine Christians—Christians
who think that to stand
well with the world, to get into “good society,”
to be always very respectable, and to
have as little cross-bearing as possible, is the
golden mean of religious life. Young men, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the name of all that is true and noble, set
yourselves against this style of religious profession.
The worst weakness in the world is
to fear to do a right thing because others
will criticise it.</p>

<p>There were many Christian men in Wittemberg
who said to Martin Luther, “You
don’t mean that you are going to hang up
these theses on the church door.” “Yes,”
said Luther; “they are true; they assail
damning error; my fatherland is bowing
down to antichrist.” “Pause,” said the men
who would stand well with everybody. “Is
not this zeal without knowledge? Think how
you will scandalize the University; how you
will drive off men who would follow you in a
more discreet course.” “Avaunt!” said the
reformer. “The people are perishing in ignorance.
The crowds of the common people
who come into the city to market will read
these words. Yours is not discretion, but
cowardice.” He did the deed; and as the
result of that act, Europe received the Protestant
Reformation, and the night of the middle
ages was ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>On one occasion, Nehemiah was urged by
his friends to desert the post of duty, to conceal
himself in the courts of the Temple,
for fear of would-be assassins. With heroic
decision, he replied, “Should such a man
as I flee? And who is there that, being as
I am, would go into the temple to save his
life? I will not go in.” Brave, perfumed
words!</p>

<p>During the mighty struggle for West Indian
emancipation, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton
was about to divide the House of Commons;
his friends appealed to him not to
divide. They came one by one, sat down by
his side, urged and implored him not to divide;
ministers of the crown besought him
to give way. In the whole House there was
only one who hoped and prayed that he
would be true to the cause of the slave, and
that one was his daughter in the gallery. He
was true to the cause of humanity; and that
division, Lord Althorp declared, decided the
question of emancipation. The question was
next introduced before the House as a Cabinet
measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>There went from Manchester to the British
parliament, about twenty-five years ago,
a comparatively young man. He went up to
London from a conference of ministers of
religion who had assembled to secure cheap
bread for the people. That conference had
been satirized; not a solitary ecclesiastical
dignitary had ventured to be present; the
leading journal had attempted to cover it
with ridicule. That young senator ventured
to defend the conference before a crowded
House of Commons. His reference was hailed
with contemptuous laughter; the greatest
statesman of the day rebuked him. Observe!
that young man lived to receive an apology
from that statesman, to hear him introduce
the measure which had been so unpopular,
and to receive himself the designation which
his name will bear through all coming times,
“The Apostle of Free-trade.”</p>

<p>I say, where you feel that you are right,
be true to yourself; do not take your cue
from other men. They may be weak, or
prejudiced, or trimmers, or cowards. Why
should you lose your individuality for them?</p>

</div>

<p>To make full assertion, therefore, of your
personal character, let me ask you to bear in
mind these counsels:</p>

<p>1. <em>Do not tamper with convictions.</em> God in
mercy sends you luminous hours. He is the
pitying Friend of your soul, and is constantly
persuading it to a higher life. I am quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
sure that you cannot pass into manhood
without heavenly visitations. Do not, I implore,
neglect these visitations. Do not quiet
your conscience by a subterfuge. Do not
hold the performance of a clear duty in suspense.</p>

<p>Behold a scene of which history tells us.
There are two men standing face to face in a
Roman court in a maritime city. The one is
a young king, his beautiful queen by his side.
There is all the pomp and circumstance of
station. Chief captains and principal men
fill the royal court. Waiting servitors surround
the doors, and an eager multitude fill
the avenues. The other is an unattended,
unbefriended prisoner, with a chain upon his
hand. That prisoner tells of a solemn moment
when heaven flashed conviction upon
his path. He reasons with resistless logic
and eloquence in proof of the truth of Christianity.
The young king listens—is moved;
it is not merely the prisoner that stands face
to face with him, but God himself; and his
convicted conscience cries out, “Almost thou
persuadest me to be a Christian!” The assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
breaks up. The king is alone in his
chamber, and muses: “I become a Christian—the
member of a despised sect! There
is clearly truth in what I have heard; but for
me to be a Christian, what will the world
think of me? My interest and pleasures forbid
it.” The subject is dismissed, and we
have not the faintest intimation that another
opportunity of salvation ever again visited
that man. He followed his race in the pursuit
of ambition and vice; he gradually lost
influence and power; his days became troubled
and disastrous, and his name remains,
like other Herods, unhonored and disgraced.
What of that other man—that unbefriended
prisoner? He is the foremost man in the
world for all after times. One excepted, no
name is repeated among men so often as his.
<em>His</em> life is the life of Christendom in these
ages, and will be more and more. He has
done more for truth, righteousness, and human
salvation, than any other sinful mortal
in all ages of the world. What was the secret
of this majesty of influence? He told it
in that court. When heaven had flashed conviction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
upon his path, he did not allow pleasure
nor prejudice nor interest nor public opinion
to sway him. These are his words: “<em>I
was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.</em>”</p>

<p>My friend, it has been to many a man a
dreadful struggle to repent and turn to God.
There have been temptations formidable, and
a vacillation of the heart most perilous. But
no man can be excused from the conflict. A
young man, who became one of the most
devoted and constant Christians, was accustomed
to insist upon decision, decision, decision,
to every young man whom he addressed.
Said he, “If you expect God to help you, you
must be perfectly <em>decided</em>.”</p>

<p>2. <em>Guard against the temptations of the times.</em>
Far be it from me to utter a word that would
debar you from the recreations and excitements
appropriate to your age. Joy and
cheerfulness are your strength and heritage.
Monkish austerity and sanctimoniousness are
rarely virtues. But our modern civilization
has multiplied, under the name of pleasure,
the facilities of vice. The perils that assail
young men in great cities are so many, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
seductive, and so ruinous to body and soul,
as to make an observer tremble. If, then,
you would be obedient to the heavenly teaching,
you must resolutely resolve not to “go
in the way of evil men.” There was a time
in England when places of business were
homes. The employer admitted young men
to the domestic sanctities of his family.
They received aid from him in the formation
of acquaintances, and had even access to his
own circles of recreation. Now, young men
in cities can scarcely be said to have a home.
Some have not even the privilege of a common
room, or a fire in their chamber. They
are open, therefore, to every allurement that
promises pleasure. Places of business, moreover,
are huge establishments where the loose
moralist can cover vice by self-deceivableness,
and where the subtle infidel, the scoffer,
and the licentious mingle together. Religion
is ridiculed, and the clergy spoken of with
a sneer. Filthy books are sold and circulated—books
of infamy, which minister to
the vilest tastes, which taint and befoul the
imagination with unclean images, and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
a man can no more look at without defilement
than he can touch soft pitch and be
clean.</p>

<p>Alas, wherever a young man turns for
worldly amusement he meets danger. Large
towns swarm with brilliantly lighted saloons,
which hold out their meretricious attractions.
There is the drama, music, and art. It was
ascertained that in two hours one evening,
six hundred young men entered one music
hall in London. Were these rooms harmless,
he would be an enemy to human happiness
who objected to them. If they are demoralizing
and ruinous to the health and
character of the inexperienced, he is a friend
who points this out. It is little suspected
how women with bedizened head-dresses and
flaunty robes are holding the last shred of
their modesty; how married men hide under
white waistcoats polluted hearts; how, while
“gray hairs dance, devils laugh and angels
weep;” how bankrupts wear forced smiles,
and the wretched try their poor jokes; how
the victims of disease and death hide their
ghastliness by flowers, and light their rapid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
progress to the grave by flaring gas-light. It
is little known how thousands of young men
from the religious homes of Scotland and
Wales pass into a speedy oblivion after their
feet have once crossed the threshold of these
rooms in English cities. Alas, what a tale
might be told of fathers’ hairs whitened,
mothers’ hearts crushed, sisters’ eyes swollen
with tears, over sons once the pride of their
homes. If you would be pure, then, you
must avoid these places. They will speedily
prejudice you against religion. They will
turn your doubts into blank unbelief and
atheism. They will quench in you even the
desire for immortality. They will turn into
terror or scoffing every restraining influence.
And what help can there then be for you for
this world or for the next?</p>

<p>3. <em>Have faith in the significance of your life.</em>
There is no exaggeration when a living writer
says: “If there were the smallest star in
heaven that had no place to fill, the oversight
would beget a disturbance which no Leverrier
could compute. One grain of sand, that
did not fall into its place, would disturb, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
even fatally disorder the whole scheme of the
heavenly motions. Every particle of air has
its appointed place, and serves its appointed
end.” God, dear young man, means something
by you. Yours may not be the highest,
but there is some high work which you
may fulfil. The low grass-tuft is not the
branching cedar towering for centuries on
Lebanon; nor is it the fragrant orange-blossom,
which is plucked to deck the bridal
wreath; but neither the orange-blossom nor
cedar could render the service of that lowly
grass-tuft. In sacred converse with your
Maker, breathe the prayer, in this the formative
period of your existence: “Lord, what
wilt thou have me to do? Why have I an
existence among these living souls of this
creation? Why hast thou given me these
grand and awful endowments of thought,
reason, intelligence, speech? I look round
on the universe, and see all creatures fulfilling
their appointed service. I see the sun
filling the whole hemisphere from day to day
with his light and heat. I see at night the
stars lighting up the arch of the firmament,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
each keeping his appointed place, the silent
preacher of obedience to thy will. I see the
bird that balances its pinions on the air, testifying
of thy goodness. I learn that the tiny
invisible insect is answering its purpose in
preserving the salubrity of the atmosphere
and the purity of the water. I find every
fragrant violet of the hedgerow and every
shock of corn fulfilling a mission of serving.
I learn from thy word of the higher spirits
that dwell in thy presence, that they have
their appointed work; that angels are ministering
spirits, and do thy commandments,
hearkening to the voice of thy word; and as
I thus behold a universe where each has its
appointed place, I utter the prayer more earnestly,
“What is the meaning of my life, Father
of spirits? I share thy counsels; reveal thy
thought respecting me.” Deeply am I convinced,
my brother, that if with some such
prayer you enter upon this period of your
life, your existence wall prove no meaningless
thing; it will be instinct with influence, and
will have an end to which you will come with
unutterable rapture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>I have in the foregoing considerations
helped to answer the question how you may
assert the power of your personal character.
I by no means say that you should disparage
associations. The most useless men are those
who will never combine. Exaggerated individuality
makes a man impracticable, and
sometimes insupportable. On the other hand,
our modern danger lies in another direction.
It is so to shape ourselves by others as to
destroy force and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Gibbon tells us a tragic history, which has
been more amply narrated by Count Montalembert
in his “Monks of the West.” The
gladiatorial games of Rome were continued
until the beginning of the sixth century of
our era. They had turned a civilized people
into savage cannibals. There, in that enormous
amphitheatre, whose tiers rising above
tiers remain to this day, tens of thousands of
spectators looked down on the bloody spectacle,
and thousands of victims were slaughtered.
A holy man in the East heard of the
deeds of blood. The fire of a righteous indignation
seized him. He travelled to Rome;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
arrived there as the imperial games were being
celebrated. His soul burned against the
cruelty and the impiety. He entered the
Colosseum; burst through the waves of the
people all palpitating with ferocious curiosity.
He threw himself between the gladiators
engaged in the sanguinary combat. In
the name of the God of heaven he commanded
them to cease their murderous strife.
The pagan multitude were for a moment
panic-stricken with the holy audacity of the
Christian. Then they cried out; they rose
on him; they tore up the arches; stones
hissed around him; the gladiators completed
the work of death. But the blood of the
martyr was the last shed in that arena. The
horrid custom, which had so long resisted
the voice of humanity, ended with that testimony.
The nobleness of the sacrifice showed
the horror of the abuse. The emperor Honorius
proscribed the games of the gladiators,
and they have never been revived.</p>

<p>Without any such sacrifice you may learn
from it the might of a simple act of decision
for truth and conscience, and that by such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
noble deeds your life may have immortal
issues. Where the timid will start back in
fear, there you may bless the coming ages.
The achievements of duty have been grander
than those of the warrior. Wordsworth says
of duty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Flowers laugh before her in their beds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fragrance in her footsteps treads:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She does preserve the stars from wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the eternal heavens through her are fresh and strong.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the beginning of manhood you stand
now; a few years, and you will stand at the
end. The span is brief; the earthly life is
only one. These lines are written for your
sake alone. No interest can another have in
your living a noble life that is comparable to
the interest you have in yourself. If you find
at the end of life that you have made a grand
mistake, it will be a mistake you never can
undo. Soon the shadows will flee, and men
will be judged, not by the earthly standard,
but by what they have been and have done.
Sometimes when bales of merchandise leave
England for a colonial port, the price put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
upon them there is very different from that
they had here. So when you have gone
through the gates of death, the angels will
not ask how you stood with this world; but
they will estimate you by your fidelity, your
sympathies, the consecration of your life to
chat which was true and good. Alone you
will go into that eternity, as alone you came
into existence. Alone will you tread the path
to the throne of God; alone you will be
judged; alone will your opportunities come
up in review; alone will you carry through
eternity the results of the one earthly life
you have lived. Said a noble youth, who
lived long enough to fulfil high promise: “I
shall die as an individual; I shall be judged
as an individual: I am resolved, therefore, to
live as an individual.” It is just this purpose
to which, in God’s name, I summon you
in this address. Let it be so, my brother.
Take thy place with the illustrious ones of
all times who have lived to bless the world.
Pass on to manhood and to immortality with
the seal of God upon thy brow. And then,
when death has done its mission, disenthralled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
of flesh, thou shalt rise to the unobstructed
sphere where hinderance never
comes, and where thou shalt begin an illimitable
work. There, with thy life grafted
upon the infinite, it will be fruitful as no
earthly life can be.</p>

<p>The belief in the doctrine of growth is of
infinite moment to a young man. The difference
between one man and another lies here.
Find a young man who does not believe in
the doctrine of moral growth, or is indifferent
to it, and you may safely affirm that waste or
perdition is being invisibly inscribed upon
his forehead. On the other hand, let a young
man be thoroughly persuaded of the possibility
of the highest moral and spiritual progress,
and he not only has hold of a truth that
is saving, but if faithful, he will reach a majesty
of character, a force, and a beauty of
spirit of which no mortal can conceive. Let
me illustrate the subject of this address. You
look at a seed-corn when lodged in the earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Growth is its law. After the first discipline
of wintry frosts, it uplifts its stalk beneath
the warm breath of the south; then unwraps
from its careful green foldings its delicate
ear, and lifts it up for the golden sun to ripen
it. Arrived at perfection, it offers itself to
man for higher uses, and becomes part of his
strength. Or, again, the acorn having found
its place in the favorable soil, puts out feelers,
and sends them into the earth for more
moisture. Modestly it breaks through the
ground to take its place among its compeers
of the forest; drinks in the air, rains, and dew
of heaven; extends its little branches, twigs,
and leaflets, that its receiving-power may be
greater. Growth, unceasing, is its law. Its
beauty is the charm of the woods in May;
its topmost leaves quiver in the breeze of summer;
its strong arms beat back the storms of
autumn; and for generations and centuries it
grows in its magnificent completeness.</p>

<p>And who shall limit the growth of a young
man? How true of him, “it doth not yet
appear what we shall be.” Like the youth
who climbed mountain-heights with “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
banner of strange device,” so he may ever
see “<em>not yet</em>” shining like a star on the brow
of the future. The youth, the trusting Christian,
the devoted worker, the mature saint
are but the lowest steps of his ever-ascending
destiny.</p>

<p>One of the grandest mornings of my life
was, when I reached the pass of St. Gothard
across the Alps. Having ascended above the
sultry airs of an early Italian summer, and
slept three thousand feet above the sea-level,
I rose at four in the morning, and begged
the privilege of sitting on the roof of the diligence
by the side of the conductor. How
invigorating was the fresh mountain-air of
the morning, like the first love of a young
heart to Christ. But as the road toiled upward,
more and more ravishing was the joy.
The mountain-pines now began to open vistas
of wondrous beauty; the graceful tops of the
larches waved in their uninvaded home; the
granite rocks, with a thousand precipitous
forms, stood like sentinels to nature’s most
majestic domains; the Ticino poured down
to the sultry plains below its rushing sound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
of waters. There behind was the river, gliding
on like a silver thread of light; and
there before were glimpses of giant peaks,
with the light burnishing the peerless white
of their eternal snows. But for nine rapturous
hours we went higher; and as we ascended,
fresher grew the air, more beautiful
the leaping waterfalls, more sublime the pass
through galleries of rocky labyrinths, more
thrilling the transition from gloomy defiles
to spots of pastoral loveliness, and more
exciting the emotion as we stood at length
about nine thousand feet above the valley
below, amid the sinless silence of the everlasting
hills.</p>

<p>In a loftier sense than this, higher and even
higher may be a Christian young man’s progress.
Follow him. He is active and devoted
in all that blesses man; he rises in harmony
of character and effectiveness of influence;
he comes to have a name in the community
of men, and is a man of mark among his fellows;
to those coming on the stage of life he
becomes the pattern-man; and those who
once sneered at his decision and aspirations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
would now be glad to catch the skirts of his
garments. “Not yet,” he may say, “have
I reached the stature of growth.” Fruits
of goodness ripen in his life; wider is the
sphere he fills; he is yet more loved, trusted,
and honored; till at length he sees the gate
and the glory of the city he is going to; above
the sounds of conflict he breathes supernal
air, and listens as there reach him from afar
the sounds of heavenly music. And when
the golden gates have been thrown back to
give him entrance, and the angels have welcomed
him, and the great and good of other
times have clasped hands with him, even then
growth in power and blissfulness shall be the
law of his being. He will rise to be a companion
of the mighty spirits of the universe.
Higher, stronger, wiser, freer, mightier, more
capable of knowing, blessing, enjoying will
be his glorious and eternal career.</p>

<p>I am dealing in no figures of speech. This
is the grandeur of man’s destiny. This is the
true law of life; and none the less true that
so many miserably fall short of it.</p>

<p>And now, young man, I speak to you who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
are just starting on a career that may be thus
sublime; and to you I say there is a <em>divine
secret</em> of this eternal growth. That secret
is in one word—<em>receiving</em>. Look again at
nature. The flowers grow by receiving.
Place them where they can receive neither
sunlight nor moisture, and they will droop
and die. As the sun arises by morning
in the heavens, they turn to him their expanded
bosoms, that his warm beams may
fall there. They spread out leaves to take in
more rain; they fold themselves in restful
quiet at night, that dew-drops may settle on
their buds and stems. After this manner man
grows. Among the sentences of Scripture
there are two which deserve to be written on
the walls of a young man’s chamber in letters
of gold: “A man can receive nothing except
it be given him from heaven.” “Every
good gift and every perfect gift is from
above.”</p>

<p>I do not mean to affirm that you are to be
passive. Go again to nature to learn her parable.
The plant grows by receiving; but it is
not, like rocks and stones, dull and inert; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
avails itself of its advantages for growth. It
coöperates in working out its perfection. It
opens its ducts; it builds upon itself new
lengths of wood; it is faithful to its gifts, and
makes every new attainment a plea for larger
blessings.</p>

<p>Dear young man, study <em>your</em> nature. In
the truly-developed man there are three powers—body,
soul, spirit. This three-fold distinction
which is made in the Bible, remarkable
to say, is also that of the latest and maturest
philosophy. The <em>body</em> grows up from
childhood by receiving; and even in mature
strength it builds up a ceaseless waste by the
same process. The <em>soul</em> or <em>intellect</em> grows by
receiving. It receives information; allows
itself to be cultured; avails itself of the stores
which other times have acquired. It never
creates. What seems so is only reaching the
full meaning or placing in new combinations
what it has received. There is, however, a
<em>spirit</em> in man. To this I turn your thoughts.
Deep in your nature is the grandest of all
your endowments. There, unthought of, it
may be, is that divine faculty which separates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
you from the brutes and allies you to
the seraphim. There, smouldering in darkness
or selfishness, is a spirit which nothing
earthly can satisfy; which sends forth aspirations
after God; which hungers after the
good; which protests against that filth of
animal indulgence under which it is often
buried; but which, on the other hand, can
be moved, and grow, and expand, and become
the dominant principle, and bring all
evil into subjection to itself, and become elevated
in wisdom and ascendency, till, shaking
off every encumbrance of corruption, its powers
are free, glorious, and triumphant.</p>

<p>Let me quote to you a sentence from one
of the profound religious thinkers of our age:
“The religious talents compose the whole
Godward side of faculty in us. There is the
talent of being illuminated, permeated, guided,
exalted by the Spirit of God. There is also
the talent or capacity of religious love. Man
can appropriate the love of God, which can
pour itself in as a tide with mighty floods of
joy and power. There is also the power of
faith, which can fall on God in recumbent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
trust, and appropriate him in all his personality
of goodness and love. These talents are
the highest, noblest, closest to divinity of all
the powers we have.”</p>

<p>Most of the visitors to the Exhibition of
Industry of 1862 saw that costliest of all diamonds,
the Kohinoor. There was a time
when that priceless gem gave not out a ray
of brilliancy. Deep in the darkness it lay;
no light shone on it; no light came back from
it. But it was placed in the light; its opaque
substance was opened. Its power of receiving
had freedom. It now allowed the minutest
ray unimpeded passage through its mass.
And then how marvellous the transformation.
It shone and glittered and shot back light
like the most brilliant star.</p>

<p>By these analogies have I sought to reveal
to you the nature of that spiritual growth to
which you are summoned. Hearken, I implore
you, to the cry of your own immortal
spirit. Open your nature, that you may receive
the quickening life of the Almighty.
You hear at this time much about religious
cant and hypocrisy. It seems as if even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
better class of novelists of our period could
never expound their own moral principles
without a contemptuous sneer at the religious
phraseology or life of their fellow-Christians.
But let me tell you, the cant
which is the most irrational, and the hypocrisy
which is the most insane, is that which
deems it manly to live without communion
with God. Ashamed to be in communion
with heaven! Ashamed to be inspired by
your Creator! What madness would be
this—if the sapphire should be ashamed of
the light that makes its beauty; if the quivering
beech-leaves should be ashamed of the
sunbeams that dance on their smooth surface;
if the flowers should be ashamed of the
daybreak that reveals their hues; if fields,
hills, and the whole realm of nature should
be ashamed of the precious influences which
the heavens pour down upon them. But for
you, a child of God, to be ashamed of receiving
illumination and impulse, wisdom and elevation,
from the Father of your spirit, is the
most pitiable misjudgment of which any creature
can be capable. Talk of religious cant—there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
is no cant that is so hateful, because
there is no cant that is so unreflecting and
senseless, as that which sneers at man having
fellowship with his Maker. It is God,
my brother, who gives to every star its brightness,
to every cloud its nameless colors, to
every lily its snowy whiteness, to every tiny
ocean-shell its mingled hues. Oh, then, go
to him. Ask him to condescend to bless you
with his indwelling life, to give power to the
right thing in your nature, to irradiate you
with his light, to actuate you by his love, and
to be an impulse of perfection within you.
As you open your nature to receive God, the
spirit within you will spring forward; it will
respond swiftly to the touch of its original
Source; it will rise in protest against the
weaknesses and passions that have choked
and smothered it. Blessed with the movements
of God, it will glow, develop, acquire
ascendence; it will bring all your nature
into harmony and peace; it will be an
impulse to all that is “lovely and of good
report.”</p>

<p>But observe this, my friend—if you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
hearken to your carnal inclination; if you
will give heed to the drivelling folly of fools;
if you will not receive Christ; if you will
have none of his counsels, none of his institutions;
if you will choose none of his ways—then
in you there never can grow up a spirit
trained for perfect bliss. Men object to hell.
What is hell, but to be outside the loyalty
and love of heaven? It is an infinite right
due to the universe to keep out of heaven a
spirit that has rejected the aid that would
have made it fit for heaven. It may be a
mercy to keep a soul, all of whose tastes are
carnal and earthly, out of heaven, as it is a
mercy to take a creeping worm out of uncongenial
sunlight, and place it in darkness. If
you have allowed idiots to teach you that it
is manly to sneer at prayer to God, what right
have you to complain if you remain unblessed
by God? If you deliberately choose darkness
instead of light, what wrong is done you if
you are left in the “outer darkness,” whatever
that may be? If a flowering plant should say,
“I will not have what heaven’s influences can
do for me,” it would be righteously excluded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
in its hideous deformity, from the monarch’s
banqueting-hall. Ah, that plant <em>must</em> be
obedient. But you, akin to the angels, have
the awful liberty of disobedience. If you
choose not Christ, it will be because you
harden your heart against him; because you
close your nature to the heavenly drawings
that would bless you. There is a passage of
Scripture of fathomless significance. The
gracious gifts of God to the spirit of man are
said to be to eternal life, but “sin” is said to
“<em>reign unto death</em>.” Yes, the principle of sin
in the nature, if yielded to, if not overcome
by God’s Spirit, quenches the innocence of
infancy and the purity of youth; corrupts the
imagination, defiles the affections, inflames
the passions, hardens the feelings, degrades
soul and spirit to be slaves to the flesh, deadens
religious capacity, extinguishes holy susceptibility,
darkens the understanding to the
things of God, makes gross the heart, dulls
the hearing, murders the angel in a man, and
kills every heaven-directed aspiration; and
then—and then—what remains for such a
spirit but to abide in death, and be left to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
wander for ever in the unknown realms of
disloyalty and everlasting darkness?</p>

<p>On starting in life, then, I would charge
and beseech you to rise to the true elevation
of your nature. Among men there are <em>five
classes</em>. The <em>lowest</em> class are the slaves of
fleshly appetites. These are the sensual, the
debauched, the lascivious, the drunken. The
<em>second</em> class obey the world, and judge after
the worldly standard. These are the lovers
of pleasure, lovers of style, lovers of money,
lovers of power. The <em>third</em> class are the intellectual.
Wisely they culture intellect, but
they neglect the heart. They acquire information,
but not benevolent emotions. They
investigate nature, but do not see the glories
of nature’s God. Higher still, there is the
<em>fourth</em> class—the moral. They are the soul
of honor; they love liberty; they teach political
principles; they profess to comprehend
the duties that man owes to his neighbor.
The summit, however, of greatness, is when,
with attention to intellect and moral laws,
there is the development of the capacity of
religion. It is here humanity culminates—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
development of the spirit in man. These
of the <em>highest</em> class are lighted up from within
by the Spirit of God. By the inbreathing of
the Almighty, they have understanding of
things unseen; they do not despise intellect,
but intellect in them is warmed and vivified
by a divine brightness; they honor morality,
and seek a right standard for measuring its
duties; they fall into the movements of the
Perfect Mind and the Perfect Love; they
learn to renounce self, to control the fleshly;
they acquire a disposition that can forgive;
they are prompted to do good, and are enlarged
with beneficence; they have aptitude
for spiritual enjoyments, and receive constantly
new accessions of joy and power,
whereby they become fitted for those blissful
regions where love, purity, nobleness,
peace, and benignity have place for ever.</p>

<p>Young man, just beginning your immortal
existence, behold your true destiny. Oh, for
God’s sake and your own sake, do not fall
short of it! Here is the culminating point
of humanity. Do not be degraded, and live
unworthy of yourself. This is the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Christ’s gospel: not merely to save, as a man
is saved from fire or from drowning—just
brought out of the water or the flames alive;
but to save by conducting a human spirit
to the victory over sin, self, and the world.
“I am come,” said the Saviour, “that they
might have life, and that they might have it
more abundantly.”</p>

<p>This elevation to which I call you is not in
opposition to other attainments—it embraces
them. Piety will not give the intellectual
talent which nature has withheld; but, if
true, it will vastly improve whatever intellect
a man has. It will not supply high reasoning
powers if they were not there before; but
it will save reason from that blindness of conceit
and prejudice whereby so many are fatally
hindered and misled. With piety, a man’s
intellect will be keener, his understanding
will be sounder, his judgment will be wiser,
and his tastes improved and refined. Rich
and Cobden is represented as having declared
that he never felt confidence in a man who
was not possessed by religion; he was not at
all sure what action he would take. Myriads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of facts confirm the observation of the statesman.
Of two poets, otherwise equal, the
Christian is the greater, of two statesmen,
the Christian attains the more permanent
fame; of two artists equally gifted, the Christian
takes the higher place; of two merchants
equally practical and far-seeing, the Christian
reaches the surest success. There were Arabian
sheiks as magnanimous as Abraham;
but none acquired his ascendency over all
times and nations. There were in Egypt
many learned men besides Joseph; but none
so influential. There were many great kings
of the East besides David; but none reached
his elevation. There were many wise men
in Babylon besides Daniel; but none so
illustrious. There were in his age many
scholars like Paul; but none who so powerfully
affected humanity. There were many
Saxon kings who loved their country like
Alfred; but none so great. There were in
his times many who loved liberty like Milton;
but none whose writings are more read in
these. There have been many investigators
of nature like Sir Isaac Newton; but none so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
distinguished. There have been many soldiers
who have won splendid honors like
Washington; but none whose name is such a
spell of might to a great nation as is his.
There were many great statesmen in England
when this century commenced; but none
who died so popular and so honored as Wilberforce.
There have been many princes
who have been cultured and benevolent; but
none whose name “hereafter and for all
times” will be such “a household word” as
that of Albert the Good. <em>These were all men
of sincere piety.</em> Ah, I might tell out a record
of names that would have towered to the
loftiest heights; but around which there are
sad and awful memories through the absence
of a governing and master sentiment of the
soul. No prejudice is so contradicted by facts
as that which conceives of piety as allied with
weakness. Piety is the nurse, the handmaid,
the inspirer of all that can give man greatness.
“A man’s religion,” says Dr. Huntingdon
very finely, “fertilizes the whole field of
his being. It makes his business safer, his
scholarship wiser, his manhood manlier, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
joy healthier, his strength stronger. It is the
crown of his enterprise and the charm of his
affections, the humility of his learning, and
the glory of his life. And because it has
sight of things not seen and eternal, it is the
splendor, the transfiguration, and the sanctity
of things seen and temporal.”</p>

<p>Observe, however, it is not greatness to
which I would urge you. There is the <em>attractiveness</em>
of piety, which, in the humblest
sphere you can exemplify. Oh, the beauty
and power of a man who has tranquillized
passion, has subdued the lower appetites, has
acquired gentleness and considerateness, amenity
and affectionateness; and who, reposing
in the love of Christ, and taught by the Spirit
of Christ, is having formed in his life some
transcript of the superhuman loveliness which
dwelt in Christ himself.</p>

<p>This, then, is the point to which I come.
If you would have your nature to reach the
highest place of which it is capable, yield
yourself to God. You cannot create the good
in yourself. You can no more form yourself
to the divine and heavenly than the rosebud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
can open its beauties without sunlight or
atmospheric moisture. It is your happiness
to receive. It is your privilege to open your
nature that you may receive. The holy and
all-helpful Spirit will swiftly draw near at the
voice of your sincere cry to him. Myriads
have proved this on earth: a multitude which
no man can number affirm it in heaven.</p>

<p>It was once my privilege to know one—the
Rev. Jonathan Glyde of Bradford—in whom
the combination of excellencies I have sketched
was exemplified. His had been for many
years the reach after this moral and spiritual
perfection; and he attained, as many admiringly
witnessed, his own ideal of gentleness
and dignity, consideration for others and
abnegation of self, beautiful humility and
scholarly attainment, saintly purity and unfailing
charity, childlike reliance upon the
Saviour, and unwearied zeal for his fellow-men.
When he was dying he was heard
gently to murmur, “Higher, higher!” His
attendants, misconceiving his meaning, approached
the head of his bed to raise the
pillows. Seeing their mistake, he fell back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
upon the Latin word, and with an ineffable
smile, raised his enfeebled hand, saying,
“Excelsior, excelsior!” To his waiting spirit
the glimpse was given at that moment of the
career of immortal glory, growth, and blessedness
which was then before him.</p>

<p>And now, in view of what has been said,
let me add these counsels.</p>

<p>1. <em>Religion is the necessity of your existence.</em>
If, like Cain, you had stood at the beginning
of the race, there might have been some excuse
for you in attempting to find happiness
without God; but you stand with the open
book of six thousand years behind you.
There has not been a solitary case of a nation,
or individual, who resolved to find permanent
happiness in sensual things, who has not been
disappointed. Read history: you will see
how the experiment has been tried again
and again, and has always failed. Babylon
tried it, with every advantage of Oriental
luxury and splendor, and failed. Greece
tried it, with every advantage of art and literature,
and still the wisest men busied themselves
to find the lost treasure of human happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Rome tried it, with every advantage
of wealth and spectacle, and the more we
pierce to the heart of society in Rome’s
proudest days, the more do we find despair
preying there. England tried it in the days
of the second Charles. Puritanism had been
silenced; godliness was satirized on the
stage; lust was the commodity of poets and
wits; license was the fashion; but the unrest
and craving of society grew deeper, louder,
and more troubled, as rivalries, intrigues,
and licentiousness abounded.</p>

<p>It has been the same with individuals.
You have been told of the gay Lord Chesterfield
recording at the close of an enviable life
of fashion and pleasure, “I am now wise
enough to feel and attest the force of Solomon’s
reflections, that all is vanity and vexation
of spirit.” Mr. Lewes tells us in his life
of Goethe, that the great poet wrote at thirty
years of age: “The period in which I have
mingled with the world I dare not yet trust
myself to look at. God keep me, that I be
not as those who spend the day in complaining
of headache, and the night in drinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
the wine which gives the headache.” In advanced
age the celebrated skeptic said of
himself, “They have called me a child of fortune,
nor have I any wish to complain of the
course of my life; yet it has been nothing
but labor and sorrow, and I may truly say
that in seventy-five years I have not had
four weeks of true comfort. It was the constant
rolling of a stone that was always to be
lifted anew.” To me, as a Christian, such
a testimony is inexpressibly affecting. In
the seventh volume of “Gibbon’s History”
you will find a description of the founder of
the city, palace, and gardens of Zehra, three
miles from Cordova. Three millions sterling
were spent. Sculptors and architects were
invited from Constantinople. Nothing that
the world could render to minister to the
tastes and passions of the caliph was wanting.
After his death this authentic memorial
was found in his cabinet: “I have now reigned
above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved
by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies,
and respected by my allies. Riches,
honors, power, and pleasure have waited on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear
to have been wanting to my felicity. In this
situation I have diligently numbered the
days of pure and genuine happiness which
have fallen to my lot: they amount to <span class="smcap">fourteen</span>!
O man, place not thy confidence in
this present world.”</p>

<p>In mentioning these things, I have no desire
to detract from the real happiness there
is in human life. There are a thousand sources
of enjoyment that are open to you. Life
is joyous—it has its endless gratifications;
but I solemnly tell you that you will be utterly
disappointed if you seek happiness apart
from personal goodness and from God. Why
should you ignore the testimony of all times?
Why should you not avail yourself of this
universal experience? Why should you, by
the wreck of your own comfort, add your life
to be another beacon of warning? No doubt
sin has its fascination; but if men whose opportunities
were greater than your own tell
you that at “the end it biteth like a serpent
and stingeth like an adder,” is it not consummate
folly for you to shut your ears to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
testimony? You are too good for the world;
“you are of too noble a make and too lofty a
mien” to give yourself to any thing lower
than God. There was a young man starting
in life, as you are. He had not your advantages.
He was surrounded by the licentiousness
of a corrupt paganism. He went wildly
astray into vicious indulgence. Little more
than thirty years had gone over his head
when he turned aside from the gratifications
of passion, and then he poured out his soul
in “confessions” which have come down to
us, and which tell us in eloquent, pathetic
tones that man is doomed to an unsatisfied
craving till he turns to know, to love, and to
serve God. You may be able to read these
noble Latin words which have been well
quoted by a university preacher from the
great Augustine’s first confession: “<i lang="la">Fecisti
nos ad Te, Domine, et inquietum est cor nostrum
donec requiescat in Te.</i>”</p>

<p>2. <em>Take heed of the first wrong step.</em> In the
Life of the late Mr. Baines, Member of Parliament
for Leeds, it is recorded that one day
he was watching an apprentice, whose habits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
were doubtful, fold a newspaper. At the first
fold there was a wrinkle, and at every succeeding
fold the wrinkle grew worse and more
unmanageable. Mr. Baines said significantly,
“Jem, it is a bad thing to begin wrong.” The
poor fellow found it so, for he soon after
fell a victim to his vices. “Who ever was
content with one sin?” said a heathen moralist.
There are, indeed, young men who, in
an unguarded moment, have gone into scenes
of temptation, and have turned away with
horror and recoil, like a bird that, having
strayed into the poisonous atmosphere of
chemical works, has rushed back quickly to
the pure air of heaven. But such cases are
the exceptions. There is a witchery about
sin. One lie demands a second to back it;
and thus a man becomes that most contemptible
and hopeless of men, a confirmed liar.
A great preacher, the late Dr. Winter Hamilton,
once said that he had known men of all
other kinds of wickedness converted; but a
confirmed liar he had never known converted.
One night in a music and dancing saloon
may so pollute the imagination as to break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
down the barriers of years. One throw at a
gaming-table, one bet on a race, may so excite
the craving for this perilous speculation that
it may be followed by the frenzy and suffering
of years of gambling. One indulgence of
the lusts of the flesh may so damn a man in
his own eyes that in a year he may be utterly
foul. Dear young man, nothing deadens the
conscience so much as sin; nothing creates a
desire for repetition so much as sin; nothing
so rises in its demands from every concession
made to it so much as sin. Among the
most striking things in our language is a sentence
of Jeremy Taylor on the progress of
sin: “Sin startles a man—that is, the first
step; then it becomes pleasing; then it becomes
easy; then delightful, then frequent;
then habitual, then confirmed; then the man
is impenitent, then obstinate; then resolves
never to repent, and then is damned.” My
young brother, it is in mercy that our heavenly
Father sweeps away all the trifling with
sin by those strong but loving words, “Thou
shalt <em>not</em>.” Our poor self rises; passion raises
its tempest of desire; experts in vice solicit;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the wrong waits to claim us and hold dominion
over us, and our good God, who sees the
end, says, “Go not in the way of evil men;
avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass
away.” It is just now, when boyhood is over,
that you are to gain the victory. Hearken
to that true man within you. Listen to that
protest of God’s Spirit in your soul. Resolve
to obey and conquer, and the victory will
make you stronger, and make temptation
weaker. No one, however, can win the victory
for you. The test to prove whether you
will be ignoble or noble, is for you to grapple
with. With the first temptation, then, contend;
for it may be a fight for life or death.</p>

<p>I know there is a maxim very common that
“a young fellow must sow his wild oats.”
They shall not be my words that reply to
that saying. They shall be those of a man
who knows the world, and an ardent lover of
the pure pleasures of the world. “In all the
range of accepted British maxims,” says Mr.
Thomas Hughes, M. P., “there is none, take
it all in all, more thoroughly abominable than
this one as to the sowing of wild oats. Look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
at it on which side you will, and I will defy
you to make any thing but a devil’s maxim
of it. What a man, be he young, old, or middle-aged,
sows, <em>that</em>, and nothing else, shall he
reap. The one only thing to do with wild
oats, is to put them carefully into the hottest
part of the fire, and get them burnt to dust,
every seed of them. If you sow them, no
matter in what ground, up they will come,
with long tough roots like couch-grass, and
luxuriant stalks and leaves, as sure as there
is a sun in heaven—a crop which it turns
one’s heart cold to think of. The devil, too,
whose special crop they are, will see that they
thrive, and you, and nobody else, will have to
reap them; and no common reaping will get
them out of the soul, which must be dug
down deep again and again. Well for you if
with all your care you can make the ground
sweet again by your dying day. ‘Boys will
be boys’ is not much better, but that has a
true side to it; but this encouragement to the
sowing of wild oats is simply devilish, for it
means that a young man is to give way to the
temptations and follow the lusts of his age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>As I am in these addresses to picture life
as it is, and to let facts speak, I will still add
corroborative instances that have fallen under
my own observation. I feel sure that hundreds
of young men would have shunned
vice if facts had been told them of its issues.
They have few to tell them. It is intensely
disagreeable to tell them. But I cannot see
young men coming into our great cities without
forewarning them of the rocks ahead of
them. While these sheets were passing
through the press, I had a most painful illustration
of the ruin and sorrow following upon
the indulgence of sin. A young man came
to London, bearing with him the confidence
and affection of a godly and afflicted mother,
the pride of a Christian father, and the yearning
love of pure and beautiful sisters. Because
of his intelligence and probity, he was
placed in a situation of trust, and went on
well while the thought of home and its sanctities
was with him. The tempter tried her
arts, and caught him in her wiles. The expenses
of the dancing-room and the habits it
led to were beyond his limit of wealth. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
took from intrusted money; the embezzlement
was not at first discovered. He grew
confident. Satan wrapped blinding folds
around him. Alas, the success was brief.
From a gloomy prison he sent up a message
to ask my prayers for him. I do not know
him. None will know him through this reference.
At twenty-one he has brought a
dark shadow over his life-dawn. Deep as is
the darkness, it may be God’s only means of
answering his mother’s prayers. Alas, for
five years of his imprisonment has that mother’s
heart to be riven!</p>

<p>When I was a minister in Leeds, a fine
youth came to that town. He was a native
of a far-off land. He came to acquire mechanical
knowledge more perfectly prior to
becoming head of a great house. Wealth
and possessions were before him. An attached
family circle delighted in him. He
was amiable, fascinating, and naturally generous.
A group of wild young men determined
to allure him to pleasure and sin. He
fell into the snare. The billiard-room was
visited; it led to the tavern, and then to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
brothel. His kind employer remonstrated
with him and pointed out the consequences
of his courses. It was of no avail. He had
consulted the “secret physician,” or, rather,
quack. A severe cold brought to a climax
his virulent disorder. His magnificent form
was tossed upon a bed of anguish. Loved
ones hastened over the sea to seek to save
him. It could not be. So loathsome was his
chamber that nurses could hardly be secured
to attend him, and those most loving him
rushed overpowered from his bedside. His
pearly teeth all dropped out, and at length,
decayed and agonized, he died a dreadful,
hopeless death.</p>

<p>3. <em>Be courageous.</em> I have spoken of the
perils of great cities. I might speak of their
grand opportunities. They are the schools
for the highest education of which man is
capable. They have their thousand instrumentalities
for noble development. They
have their incitements to the most pleasurable
excitation. They bring a collision of
mind largely beneficial. They open channels
for benevolence and greatness as no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
other places do. But my advice is, let no
man come to a great city without courage.
If he is weak, yielding, cowardly, let him not
venture upon the encounters of a city life.
Let a youth aim to live a godly life, and the
sluggish will sneer, the empty-souled will
laugh, the wicked will throw out sarcasms.
Woe to the man who cannot brave the laugh
of fools. My friend, it is the first step that
costs. My observation leads me to say that
fast and depraved men, with all their brag,
are the greatest cowards. They like to make
conquest of the inexperienced, but their
forced laugh very poorly covers the secret
awe they have of the manly and the firm.
They know what is the right thing to do,
spite of their sarcasms. Do I say, Trust in
yourself? By no means; if you wish to be
brave, God will provide you armor. If, on
the other hand, you go into the world saying,
“I am not of the sort that yield; I am,
afraid of no danger,” then let me say there
is fear for this self-confidence. It is a proverb
we need to repeat to ourselves: “Seest
thou a man wise in his own conceit, there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
more hope of a fool than of him.” But be
sure, my young brother, God is interested in
your going the right way. He loves to help
those who call upon him. I think of David
as a young man crying to his pious mother’s
God: “Save the son of thy handmaid.”
Morning by morning ask God to arm you
from head to foot, and then be strong and
courageous.</p>

<p>4. Having decided on the right course, <em>go
forward</em>. That right course is before you.
No past guilt of yours is a barrier. “Christ
has put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.”
There is an open pathway of reconciliation
on which you may walk. But oh, for God’s
sake and your own sake, when you have
found that path, do not stand still. I have
known young men who started well: their
standard was high; their ideal of what Christianity
demanded was just and lofty. They
resolved they would scorn the mean, the
money-loving, the selfish in life. They wound
their conscience up to that point. But there
the finger stopped, just at that figure: it told
out still what their ideal had been at starting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
And this was all; the clock did not go.
They now have no sound, no tone about
them. They still say they scorn the mean,
without aiming to <em>do</em> noble things; they still
tell you they hate avarice, but they are not
benevolent; they have their theories about
selfish Christians, but none bless them for
their self-renouncing deeds. This is of all
things the most pitiable, that a man should
sink lower than his own standard, and go
through life false to himself.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I surely need not say, Turn not back. Should
the eagle which has soared higher than his
compeers break his pinion, he would drop
lower than the lowest. It is related that in
the American War of Independence, the army
of Washington had crossed a bridge over a
deep river. With the river behind and the
enemy in front, the great general proposed
the question to his officers: “Shall we burn
the bridge?” “Burn it!” said the staff; “we
may want it for a retreat.” “Retreat!” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Washington; “if that is the only reason for
retaining it, then it must perish.” “Burn
the bridge!” was his instant order; and it
was laid in ashes.</p>

<p>5. <em>Cultivate helps to the spiritual life.</em> That
life cannot take care of itself. It sprung
forth first to meet the touch of God’s Spirit,
and it can only grow and become strong by
communion with the Spirit. You see some
who appeared to be religious youths at fourteen,
and who are worldly at twenty. No
doubt there were fine religious susceptibilities
which were quickened into activity at the
former period, and which gave them vantage
ground for a fine start; but they lived on
themselves, which is the same as feeding the
body upon emptiness. No wonder their apparent
religious life should have died. It is
very much to be deplored, that with the facilities
which are afforded to many through
early closing movements, the opportunities
for social religious culture should be passed
by. Remember the secret of growth I have
indicated—coöperation with God. When a
man has saplings in his orchard which bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
only wild fruit, like a good orchardist he
seeks to improve them by grafting. He cuts
his grafts from a last year’s growth of wood;
takes care that they do not evaporate their
moisture; then on the stocks grafts his scions
If a sapling is unbenefited; if the wood above
the graft is just like the wood below, which it
ought not to be; or if the fruit be of a mongrel
kind, partly of the original stock and
partly of the scion, what will he do? Try
again, it may be. But if, after repeated trials,
he has the same result, he will reject his unprofitable
stocks, and turn his attention to
fresh young trees. This is Christ’s law of
spiritual life. That which beareth not fruit
receiveth no more attention from the husbandman.
“When a young man has much
given to him—religious training, divine movements
on his soul, glimpses of the beauty and
blessedness of a religious life—if then there
is a self-confidence, badness of heart, levity
with Scripture, negligence in prayer, trifling
with holy things, indifference to growth, then
Christ suspends the vital influences. The
branch remains, but it is sapless, lifeless, joyless.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
If the little life is in thy heart, my
brother, let me implore thee to seek its
growth by prayer, by public and social worship,
by seeking acquaintance with the mind
of the Spirit in holy Scripture. The <cite>Times</cite>
newspaper—and the testimony of a secular
journal may have weight on this matter—said
not long ago in a leader: “We question
if any person of any class ever read the Scriptures
regularly and thoroughly without being
or becoming not only religious, but sensible
and consistent.”</p>

<p>6. <em>Ally yourself with the like-minded.</em> You
will take your character from your chosen
companions. You may not mean it, but you
cannot help it. “He that walketh with wise
men will be wise,” saith the proverb, and the
reverse side is true also. As a religious
young man you cannot stand alone. Associate
yourself with the aspiring. Seek the
sympathy and helpfulness of a Christian
church. You will not do this because you
are strong, but because you feel weak. You
will go into a church not because you are
wise and holy, but because you need prayers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
and the impulse of mutual fellowship.
There is a most unreasoning prejudice in this
age against church communion. “Do not be
a sectary,” you will be told. You may reply:
“There never has been an age in England
when the very best, holiest, and most useful
men were not counted sectaries.” The grandest
works which have gone to save and bless
the world have been done by Christian denominations;
the noblest of men have been
in firm alliance with some Christian church.
The outsiders have mostly been the critics,
the sentimental, and the ineffective. As a
young man, a Christian organization offers a
grand scene for your labors and for your dignified
influence.</p>

<p>It may be you feel you cannot take your
place among the righteous. Let me then
conjure you not to let a day pass without
resolving that you will give yourself in loyalty
through Christ unto God. He is calling
you through these words to glory and virtue.
He strives with you to win your love.
His garments have been dyed in blood for
your salvation. He bows himself to you and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
deigns to knock at the door of your heart.
Oh, for the sake of what is holiest, dearest,
infinite, do not resist his pleadings. On this
the starting-point of your manhood, you are
in your own power. God appeals to you and
says: “I set before you life and death.” The
end of life now seems far off. Believe me it
will come sooner far than you think. Ceaselessly,
noiselessly, swiftly will life pass. Your
life must be looked back upon. If, after your
opportunities, it is proved to have been a life
of waste and evil influence, heavier will be
your remorse and doom. May God in mercy
grant that yours may be the place among the
consecrated ones who have blessed humanity,
and who now know the meaning and
grandeur of a destiny that called them to
glory and immortality.</p>

<p>Thus do I lay these counsels before you,
my friend, as you enter upon life. They
have been written amid the demands of a
large charge and the wearying claims of
public life. They might have been better.
But they are the outpouring of an intensely
anxious heart. Looking back upon the past,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
I feel, with thousands more, that the great
boon of existence was the disposition to ally
my nature with Christ’s when eighteen years
of age. From that time with what inexpressible
benignity, patience, and sympathy, has
Christ helped me! And now, should I be
called to no other service, in the closing moments
of life the hope that these few words
had induced some young men to choose
Christ and all his mighty love, would be
most precious and grateful to my heart.
This I know, that if old age is welcomed
when it brings to Christ only the relics of a
wasted life; for you, when you offer him the
force of your will, the glow of your affections,
the opening powers of your intellect, for you
there will be more than welcome; there will
be “lavish acknowledgment.” He will deign
to call it “the kindness of your youth,” which
he will “remember” for ever.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> There is a sin of which I can hint only to you. Alas,
its terrible temptations and its awful consequences are
becoming frightful. It is not safe to omit notice in an
appeal to a young man who may be entering life in a
great city. If you could know the little that has come to
my knowledge, your very hairs would stand on end. I
could tell you of the finest physical constitutions, which,
after twelve months’ tampering with this perilous fascination,
have become pitiable wrecks of disease. I could tell
you, on medical authority, of men now dragging out a
useless existence, with reason dethroned, and drivelling
in idiotcy. And the punishment once done to the flesh
does not depart. Life ends in early death, or is a long
suffering of humiliation; yea, worse still, the suffering is
perpetuated in the third and fourth generations. Young
men starting in life have none to tell them these things,
therefore I have forced myself to the hateful task. The
displeasure of God against this sin is awful. What would
you think of a man who should pluck a flower from a
yawning chasm, when there were ninety-nine chances
to one that he would fall into the abyss below, and even
if extricated, be scarred and begrimed to the end of his
days?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Not very long since, a public lecturer was proceeding
to Sheffield, and in a railway train astounded me by arguing
that the apostle Paul preached the gospel before Jesus
Christ was crucified. A Sunday-scholar of seven years of
age would have taught him better. I was lately in a large
meeting in Pentonville, when an intelligent man, who
avowed himself a skeptic, who had read Mr. Buckle’s
“History of Civilization,” declared that men who believed
the Bible could never be expected to attend to man’s
social condition; for that Christ taught, in John 6, that
we were “not to labor for the meat which perisheth.”
Now mark, the very verse before the one quoted tells us
that a multitude had followed Christ, not at all caring for
what he would teach them, but because he had fed them
with loaves and fishes. Their miserable motive he exposed,
and bid them labor for meat which endured unto
everlasting life. Suppose a son of this skeptic had taken
what professed to be a letter from his mother, and singled
out a clause from its context to bring the letter into contempt
before a meeting, what would that father have called
such a son? A scoundrel. God probably pities him as
he would not his son. But let young men take heed of
reasoning which is not merely a reproach to candor, but
to common intelligence.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h3>

</div>

<p>Several years ago a man, now venerable for
age and character, gave the writer some valuable
hints about boys and young men in relation to
business. He had himself begun life a poor
boy, and achieved large success. Coming to
New York more than sixty years ago, he was
familiar with all the changes in methods of doing
business up to the time then present. Nor has
he ceased to be active in the affairs of a large
concern at this later day. The passing years
have made him old and have not left me young.
The thoughts he gave me, supplemented by my
own reading, observation and reflection, move me
to set down some things that may be helpful not
only to the classes of persons already referred to,
but to others as well.</p>

<p>The great change in business methods does
not warrant any change in the characters and
habits of those who have a right to expect success
in any true meaning of the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>I would gladly speak a helpful word to the
thousands of boys and young men who are looking
hopefully into the future, and yet may not
have in mind the true conditions of well-doing
for themselves or their employers.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>BOYS.</i></span></h3>

</div>

<p>If there were no boys there would be
no young men and no old men. To this
truism add the saying, “The boy is the
father of the man,” and our subject has
dignity and greatness at the outset. There
may be aspects of it that provoke merriment;
but there are more of a different
character, and we are kept sober-minded
in view of them.</p>

<p>The boy on shipboard is the “monkey.”
The boy among types and presses is the
“printer’s devil.” The boy at school is
“Jack,” or “Bill,” or “Dick,” “hail-fellow
well met,” and a peer among peers. The
boy in college, if any boys go to college,
is a “Freshman,” bound—if not happily
emancipated of late—to serve the learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
“Sophomore,” or take a ducking, or something
worse, for his disobedience.</p>

<p>In business the boy is just what his
character, his companions and his employers
make of him. He may be a butt of
ridicule, or a greenhorn to be ripened
into smartness and wickedness by those
who are older and wiser and worse than
himself. He may be a poor drudge, to
sweep and run of errands, which may be
all right; or to suffer untold indignities
and cruelties, with no uplifting to a better
future and very little pay for very much
work, which is all wrong.</p>

<p>Or, by way of contrast, he may be treated
from the start as having in him the
germ of real greatness, the undeveloped
qualities of a man yet to be acknowledged
as the peer of those he serves, and the
possible superior of them all. No one but
God knows what may be hid and struggling
for opportunity and recognition and
reward in the obscurest little fellow who
takes the lowest place in any store or office
or shop.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>EMPLOYERS IN RELATION TO BOYS.</i></span></h3>

</div>

<p>I do not think the first thing to be considered
is what a boy may do for his employers,
but rather what they may do for
him, and so, at last, for themselves through
him. In all ordinary circumstances they
can mould him to their will. They are
the masters, he is the servant. They are
strong, he is weak. If they do not recognize
their obligation to him, in the relation
to which they invite and receive him,
they ought not to complain of his failures
in duty to them. As well expect a son to
know and meet his duties to his parents
while they utterly fail to recognize theirs
to him.</p>

<p>If an employer requires a boy to do
what in his home or the sanctuary he
has learned he must not do, and if he
requires him to do the forbidden thing on
pain of losing his place or his pay, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
requirement is not only a grievous wrong
in itself, but an outrage upon the inalienable
rights of the boy. Children are required
to obey their parents only “in the
Lord.” No man is great enough to lord
it over his own child’s conscience. And
this great principle holds in the relation
of employers to their servants of all ages
and grades.</p>

<p>Boys sell their time and service to their
masters. They cannot sell their conscience,
soul, and body. They must do
right if they lose a thousand places in
succession and starve to death for want of
work. I can think of no persecution more
cruel and infamous than that which is
practised upon boys just starting on their
career for life, here and hereafter, when
they are required to practise deceit; to
say things that are not true about goods
to be sold, or in any other way to debauch
conscience. The penalty of disobedience
may be sending them home to widowed
mothers or orphaned sisters without recommendation
to any other place of business.<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
This is martyrdom with a vengeance,
and it is by no means uncommon.
I have in mind glaring instances that
have come under my own observation.
A man now belonging to an old and
wealthy business house was thrust out of
his place when a youth because he refused
to sell goods damaged in a vital though
hidden part as goods in perfect order.</p>

<p>Another, in a position of great responsibility
and usefulness for a number of
years in a heathen land, when a boy
served his employer faithfully six days in
the week, and was required to sell his
goods on the Sabbath. His conscience
forbade this and he was discharged, with
very serious consequences for a time.</p>

<p>These are specimens of classes. But it
is always safe and wise for boys firmly
and respectfully to resist human authority
in all such cases.</p>

<p>There is another great wrong to boys,
to wit, leaving them at the mercy of
subordinates who hold positions grading
all the way from those held by the boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
themselves, to those just below the high
positions of the employers. I have seen
something of this petty tyranny; good
boys harried into desperation or pushed
and badgered into immoralities and the
loss of self-respect.</p>

<p>Happy are the boys who go from their
homes to the care of good men, and to
the companionship of co-workers who
help them to success by instruction and
example.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>BOYS IN RELATION TO EMPLOYERS.</i></span></h3>

</div>

<p>Thus far I have written some plain
things about employers in relation to
boys. With equal plainness I now write
of boys in relation to their employers.</p>

<p>Clearly they must always do right even
if the stars fall. It is weak and contemptible
to be eye-servants, showing all diligence
in the presence of employers, but
lapsing into idleness, carelessness or mischief
when they disappear. In the long
run boys that always do right will do
well. The hearts of their employers can
safely trust in them. If for no higher reason
than their own interests they will advance
them from one position to another
of responsibility and emolument.</p>

<p>But other reasons will prevail. Personal
attachments will be formed. Men
of business are commonly men of heart.
They have sons of their own and cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
help admiring the excellencies of other
people’s sons. It is not uncommon to hear
them boast of the virtues of boys employed
by them. Some time ago I was in
an office and within a few moments two
gentlemen of the firm called my attention
to a lad who was moving quietly about,
absorbed in the duties of his calling.
They spoke with great interest of his
fidelity and efficiency in relation to them;
of his great self-denial in order to minister
to the comfort of his family; and of
his brilliant prospects.</p>

<p>There is a proverb as true as when written,
“A wise servant shall have rule over a
son that causeth shame, and shall have part
of the inheritance among the brethren.”
There is another which is not infrequently
verified, and suggests a very pleasant way
in which boys grown to manhood sometimes
share in the “inheritance among the
brethren;” it is this: “He that delicately
bringeth up his servant from a child shall
have him become his son at length.”</p>

<p>Again, boys must give their best thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
and energies in business hours to the interests
of their employers. Nor should
they forget or in any way endanger those
interests out of business hours. They
are in and of the concern. They represent
it. Its reputation attaches to them and
theirs to it. It may be amusing, but it is
pleasant, and suggestive of a bright future,
to hear a boy just beginning his
business life speaking loftily of “our
house.” He belongs to its personnel.
His life mingles with its life. It is for
his interest to give much thought, at all
proper times, to the duties of his station.
If, by extra labor adding to his qualifications
for business, he can become more
useful than he was expected or is required
to be, he may cut off weary months and
even years that must otherwise lie between
him and higher service and better
pay. I knew a boy who in this way passed
over the heads of several older than himself,
and in early manhood fairly won a
position which others never reached. As
a rule, I think boys may count on being<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
promoted when they have outgrown the
places which they wish to leave. If they
can sweep stores and set things in order
better than others, and run of errands
with swifter feet, and acquaint themselves
with streets and places of business quicker
than others, they will not have to do these
things for a long time. Higher service
awaits them, and they will find that the
habits of thoroughness and dispatch already
formed are worth more and more
as they advance to higher and more responsible
positions.</p>

<p>In all things right, boys must sink their
wills in the wills of their employers. This
is not to become slaves. Children have
safest and sweetest liberty in obeying their
parents; scholars their teachers; soldiers
their commanders. In the shop, the office,
the store, there must be authority on the
one hand and obedience on the other.
Boys should rejoice that above them there
are men who, once boys like themselves,
are now wise enough and kind enough to
assign them their duties and to guide<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
them in the way to success, and firm
enough to require obedience to their directions.
Prompt and cheerful obedience
will not fail, in ordinary circumstances, to
attract the attention and secure the approbation
of employers. Wise boys will watch
for opportunities to make themselves useful,
gladly doing what has not occurred to
anyone else and yet everyone will be
glad to have done; and if they can do all
to please Him who seeth in secret and
rewardeth openly, rather than for any
lower motive, they are to be congratulated
as having made a right start not only for
this life but for that which is to come.</p>

<p>“It is good for a man that he bear the
yoke in his youth.” A great but very
sad prophet wrote these familiar words
long ago, but they have lost none of
their truth. If a thousand boys, already
in business or about to begin their business
lives, were reading the words I write,
I would put all possible emphasis in what
follows: do not fear any amount of work,
or any kind, lying fairly within your<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
power. I have been an office-boy, doing
many things, besides writing, that were
not easy or pleasant. I know that many
things needing to be done may be left
undone without incurring blame. But he
that does them wins the approval of his
own conscience and the favor of men.
If one does unpleasant things cheerfully
they lose half of their unpleasantness, and
will not have to be done many times.</p>

<p>It is mean to shirk, and it never pays.
The ease it brings for the moment is punished
by long drudgery, and he that habitually
shirks may look back at the end
of a miserable life with unavailing regrets
upon the weakness and neglect of his
early years. Even a horse that will not
draw his part of a reasonable load is despised
and whipped.</p>

<p>Blessings on the good boys that have
pluck and purpose to succeed; and may
all that are otherwise become like them,
as doubtless many of them mean to do.
“You will be proud of us one of these
days,” was the assurance of a bright but<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
mischievous boy to an anxious teacher
pleading with him and his companions to
mend their ways. A boy of this kind who
gave me great solicitude a few years ago,
as I was his pastor and the teacher of his
Sunday-school class, came suddenly under
the power of the truth. Deeply convicted
of sin, and coming to Christ on his invitation,
he was soon rejoicing in the hope
of pardon and eternal life. He is now the
efficient superintendent of a Sunday-school
and bears a most important office in the
church of which he is a beloved member.</p>

<p>“I have a noble boy,” said a deck-hand
on a ferryboat as I fell into conversation
with him. Then he gave me his history.
From his school days to full manhood his
career was honorable and his life in and
out of his church relations very useful.
To the father he was still his “boy” and
his pride.</p>

<p>Boys, you are all old enough to know
that somewhere you will live forever.
The characters you form here will go
with you into the world and the life to<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
come. If they are right here, and now,
they will be right forever and grow better
and better. If they are wrong here, and
continue so till God calls you away, early
or late, they will be wrong always and
wax worse and worse. Boys do not all
live to become old men—or even young
men. There is just one way of starting
right and being in the right way until
God calls you to a better world. Listen
to the sweet words that you have often
heard: “I love them that love me, and
those that seek me early shall find me.”
Determine to be boy Christians. Believe
that Jesus Christ, the only Saviour, loves
you. He is able and willing to save you
from the sins of your youth. If you hear
and obey his loving call he will guide and
guard you safely until you are forever
with him and like him. Believe that you
need him every hour and moment. Trust
him to do what he promises. Keep company
with those who delight in his service.
Fear God and keep his commandments.
“Remember the Sabbath day, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
keep it holy.” Cling to your Sunday-school
and church. Confess Jesus Christ
before men, and he will confess you before
his Father and the angels. If irreligious
boys make fun of you, because
they think you have given up all the
pleasures of boy-life, let them know that
the peace which God gives you is far better
than all their forbidden pleasures, and
do what you can to win them from their
evil ways to a true and blessed life.</p>

<p>In any case, boys, be sure that the favor
of God, which is life, and his lovingkindness,
which is better than life, will fit you
for the truest and best success in business.
In all your ways acknowledge him,
and he will direct your steps: God will
be your patron and friend.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>YOUNG MEN AND SUCCESS.</i></span></h3>

</div>

<p>The line between boys and young men
is invisible. Those who pass it cannot
tell where it lies. But the time comes
when they no longer admit to themselves
or others that they are boys. They bear
about the pleasant consciousness that they
are nearer the heart of a business life than
they were a while before. They may be
apprentices, collectors, entry clerks, shipping
clerks, bookkeepers, salesmen behind
the counter, or on the road, but they are
no longer boys and they are not yet partners.
A numerous class, they will become
largely the business men of the next generation.
Even now they represent immense
personal, domestic and public interests.
Who can think of them without
emotion! It does not require a broad
sweep of observation and recollection to
bring into view from the two extremes<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
young men who have utterly failed and
others who have won honorable success;
those who have sealed their own doom
and dragged others down with them to an
abyss of shame and misery, and those
who have become princes in the earth.</p>

<p>It is worth asking at the outset what
meaning we ought to attach to the words
“success” and “failure” in business.</p>

<p>We do not account him successful who
gains large wealth, leaving it to his family
and even to public institutions of great
usefulness, but who does it at the cost of
personal integrity, character and reputation.
We do not need examples of men
who have grown rich by doubtful methods
of business, by perversion of office and
trust funds, and who have already sunk
or are now sinking into depths of infamy
and woe opened by their own hands.</p>

<p>Nor is he successful who gains wealth
honestly, and hoards it—against all the
claims of humanity and the revealed will
of God—until his riches are corrupted, his
gold and silver cankered, the rust of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
even now, before the last day, eating his
flesh as it were fire.</p>

<p>Men utterly fail, though possessed of
millions, who make shipwreck of character
in the sight of their Maker and their
fellow-men.</p>

<p>Many fail for lack of qualities and habits,
and, it may be, opportunities, that condition
success. But <em>they do not</em> fail who
use all diligence, and their best wisdom
and opportunity, and yet become poor
without the loss of a good conscience toward
God and man. And they certainly
succeed who amass wealth or a competency
while maintaining their integrity
in relation to God and their honor among
men.</p>

<p>It may be well to state here some of the
well-ascertained facts in regard to the percentage
of success and failure in business,
using the words in their most limited
meaning.</p>

<p>Only from three to five in every hundred
men who embark in business have
large and permanent success. And these<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
are not chiefly those who begin with large
capital. For the most part they are men
who have been architects of their own fortunes.
Beginning as boys on low wages,
and passing through all grades of advancement
from the lowest to the highest, they
have at last become strong enough to
make their own terms with those who
have gladly recognized their ability and
integrity as the equivalent of large capital;
or without such aid they have
worked their way to splendid success.</p>

<p>About ten out of a hundred have moderate
success. Without aspiring to the
rank of millionaires they have an abundance
for personal and family use, and are
able to share freely, if so inclined, in the
beneficence of their times.</p>

<p>The remaining eighty-five in a hundred
are on a sliding scale from partial success
to utter failure. Leaving out of view all
the cases in which men of integrity and
ability fail by reason of unavoidable calamity,
or lack of opportunity, how shall
we account for the large percentage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
failures? And as the percentage continues
from year to year, and perhaps increases
from generation to generation, it
seems clear that the reasons are permanent
and powerful.</p>

<p>It certainly throws a deep shadow over
households and communities to think that
young men have before them such gloomy
prospects. Can we not brighten them?
Must every hundred young men, full of
the strength and enterprise belonging to
their age, advance toward the goal of their
ambition under the depressing thought
that only from five to twenty are likely to
win prizes? At best the cares and responsibilities
and risks of business men are
very great. But I do not believe that circumstances
external to themselves control
the business destiny of young men. They
may avoid disastrous failure and win success.
At least a very large percentage of
them may win the wholesome success
which consists in having neither poverty
nor riches; for this after all may be welcomed
as the safest and best condition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
But they may also be prepared by excellence
of character, and by habits of business
and of life, for the possession and use
of large wealth, under the great responsibility
of stewards who are yet to give account
to the real Proprietor of all the
treasures in the world.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that young
men may succeed as clerks and utterly
fail as the responsible heads of business
concerns. For this reason the conditions
of success, of which I am about to write,
have reference largely to times beyond
the years of apprenticeship and subordination.</p>

<p>Young men may enjoy the confidence
of their employers while they are disqualifying
themselves for independent action.
Devotion to their interests may secure
rapid advancement in positions and salaries.
They may be extravagant and
immoral, and yet have qualities that cover
their faults and commend them to favor.
While they remain under the direction
and control of men better and stronger<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
than themselves they may be congratulated
as already successful, while they are
bearing about in their own persons all the
conditions of sure and disastrous failure.</p>

<p>The first and fundamental condition of
real and permanent success is good character.
This may be set down without
qualification. Character is an engraving.
A good character answers to a divine ideal
or pattern. It is not made in a day, and
if marred it can be restored. Bearing the
deep cuts and finer lines of truth and righteousness
and pureness, it will bear the
violence of temptation in private, social,
and business life, and the severer testing
of the last day.</p>

<p>Of course such a character is secretly
and openly religious. Only when young
men consent to commit the keeping of
their souls and bodies to Jesus Christ, and
to bear any cross that in his love and
faithfulness he may lay upon them, can
they be strong in the Lord and the power
of his might.</p>

<p>How suggestive the words of the disciple<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
whom Jesus loved with a peculiar personal
affection: “I have written unto you,
young men, because ye are strong, and the
word of God abideth in you, and ye have
overcome the wicked one. Love not the
world, neither the things that are in the
world.”</p>

<p>I hope no young man searching for the
conditions of success in his business life,
if he reads these pages, will make light of
this, which is first and most important of
all. That cannot be called success which
secures more than heart can wish for the
life that now is, and not the life to come.
“Look well to thy goings,” was the earnest
counsel of one who knew well the
dangers of the young man. “Look well
to thy goings; it is a narrow path. Look
well to thy goings; it is a new path. Look
well to thy goings; it is a slippery path.
Look well to thy goings; it is an eventful
path.”</p>

<p>In a long life I have seen many
young men begin a business career with
great advantages and brilliant prospects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
but their light went out in darkness because
they did not cleanse their ways by
taking heed thereto according to God’s
word.</p>

<p>But I have also seen and now have in
full view young men who early sought
refuge from their sins, and from all the
perils of life, by coming frankly to Jesus
Christ in their conscious need. Invited to
his presence, and assured of his love and
help, they took him at his word and found
rest to their souls. There is no harmless
lawful pleasure that is denied them. The
peace of God is in their hearts. The service
to which they are called brings its
own reward. The joy of the Lord is their
strength. They confess Christ as their

<span class="smaller"><i>OTHER CONDITIONS OF SUCCESS.</i></span></h3>

</div>

<p>It does not follow, however, that a good
moral or religious character by itself will
ensure success in the business of life; one
must have certain well-known qualifications
and habits, and the reputation of
possessing them.</p>

<p>1. Reputation. Probably it stands next
to character, if a young man is to depend
upon others for help in his work. Character
is what one is in himself and before
God; reputation is what others take him
to be. A bad reputation certainly blocks
the way to success. A good name among
business men is the equivalent of capital.
Every young man who is starting in business
for himself must rely upon older men
to help him on his way. They have
watched others closely. They have seen
successive generations of young men come
to the front, and climb the hill of difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
till they have reached positions of safety
and honor, or go down to the abyss of dishonor
and misery. In a word, watching
others closely they have accumulated facts
that make it easy for them to forecast the
future of younger men with marvelous
certainty. They are as sensitive to the
outward appearance and the known or
suspected habits of those who approach
them for favors in trade as mercury to
the changes of temperature. No young
man can afford to have the reputation of
being extravagant, or reckless, or mean, or
untrue to his word. He cannot even appear
to be such without danger to his credit,
on which to so large an extent, as business
is done, success must depend.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of my own came to the
city a youth without capital. He was honest,
frugal, industrious, and of firm will.
Having begun business in a small way,
and mostly on credit, he was invited by a
friend—after business hours—to ride beyond
the limits of the city behind a fast
horse and with a fine turn-out. He accepted<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the invitation, but found the pleasure
of the ride reduced to a minimum by
the tormenting thought that he might be
seen by some of the men who had given
him credit.</p>

<p>In a new firm, with very large capital,
one of the younger partners secretly bought
a horse. A senior partner learning the
fact quietly informed him by letter that
his early extravagance would hurt the
reputation of the house.</p>

<p>It may be a hit at our times, but I have
seen it stated that business men sometimes
inquire of persons seeking advanced positions
whether they have already supplied
themselves with such trifles as elegant
jewelry and fast horses, hardly daring to
risk employing them if these things are
yet to be secured.</p>

<p>It remains a truth that needs to be made
very emphatic that young men laying their
plans for success in business, whether as
subordinates or principals, must look well
to their reputation.</p>

<p>Are they given to billiards? There are<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
many reasons why they would do well to
limit their indulgence. Of one thing at least
they cannot afford to make light: conservative
men older and wiser than themselves,
on whose favor they must depend
for a while at least, look with distrust on
young men who indulge largely in this
game, and especially in not very reputable
places.</p>

<p>A young man drinks beer, wine, whisky
or brandy with his dinner. This habit
will grow upon him. His young blood
needs no quicker rush than it has. If he
gives it the force of such a stimulant when
he is young he will be old before his time,
and never enjoy the full confidence of
men with whom he wishes to stand well
and without whose favor he cannot succeed.
He may not spend half his income
in extravagance but other people cannot
be sure of this, and he has need both to
deserve and keep their confidence. Credit
is the equivalent of reputation. It may
be hurt by not saving at the outset and
increasing capital. In that case one must<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
pay more for goods than men who have
better credit. Or he may not be able to
buy at all of men who know him well and
have the goods he needs. Then he must
buy of others goods that will not suit his
customers; and so his lack of credit or
loss of reputation will bring him to speedy
grief. The first bad year in the business
would leave him like a vessel that hardly
floats when the tide is at the full, but
sticks fast in the mud at the first of the
ebb.</p>

<p>2. Another condition of success is diligence.
Mark the word. It is not the
precise equivalent of industry. It implies
choice, selection, delight. One needs to
have true delight and enthusiasm in his
business. Therefore the great importance
of choosing wisely at the outset. We pity
men and women who in their babyhood
had inflicted upon them fanciful names,
but this is nothing to the blunder of putting
a son to a business in which through
his whole life he can take no delight.
His only relief is to set himself, with all<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
possible energy and enterprise, to lift his
business, supposing it to be right in itself,
up to a plane so high that he can sincerely
rejoice in his achievement, as very difficult
to make but of great worth when it
is made.</p>

<p>Diligence supposes a fixed purpose and
constancy of effort, as well as enthusiastic
devotion. When Isaac Rich trundled his
wheelbarrow from the oyster-boat in Boston
to the market-place three miles off,
having invested all his worldly goods in
what was before him, there was light in
his eye and warmth in his heart though
the day had not dawned. He was a poor
young man from Cape Cod. He had made
choice of his business for life. I do not
know how long he followed it behind the
barrow. Years ago he gave a million and
three quarters of dollars to found a college
in the city that itself yielded this
treasure to his diligence and thrift. “The
hand of the diligent maketh rich.” “Seest
thou a man diligent in his business? He
shall stand before kings. He shall not<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
stand before mean men.” Let young men
bind these divine proverbs upon their
foreheads, and write them where they can
be seen, as rules of their business lives.</p>

<p>3. Another condition of success is force,
or energy. This comes often by heredity,
transmitted from parent to child. In any
case it is a precious gift, a great talent,
for the right use of which every one receiving
it must give account. From it,
as a reserve power, one may draw at will
to push on any work in which he takes
delight. Call it the magnetic or electric
power of the will, if you please. It may
be like the same subtle fluid in destructive
flash, or like it in the crisp air of a
winter’s day, nerving one for almost tireless
effort.</p>

<p>4. It may seem almost superfluous to
add to the list of personal qualities conditioning
success in business the quality
of competency. It may be said to include
all that have been already noticed,
and all that a business man needs. It is
the state of being competent or adequate<span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
for what one has to do to win success. It
supposes that in theory and practice he
has acquired fitness for his calling. The
theory he must get by careful observation
of everything connected with his business,
by conversation with others, older and, it
may be, wiser and more gifted than himself;
by carefully reading what is current,
and what is past, bearing upon the work
he has in hand, and by much thought of
his own. He may then be able to reach
conclusions far in advance of any dreamed
of by the heedless. He studies fabrics,
woods, metals, fruits, sugars, teas, coffees,
markets, finance, men. So he grows in
mental power and the consciousness of
it. He commands an increasing influence
among business men, and learns how to
expend the force that urges him on to
larger and better ventures in trade.</p>

<p>But he must have practice with theory;
habits of doing as well as thinking. This
he can accomplish only by putting his own
hand to the work, as a child learns to write,
or to master the key-board of a piano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="B_Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>The men who take the lead of affairs,
whatever they lack, are sure to have a
most minute and entire knowledge of their
branch of business; such a knowledge as
can be got only by taking hold and doing
every part of it.</p>

<p>Young men should see things with their
own eyes, and touch and fashion things
with their own hands. With character,
and reputation and diligence and force
and competency, in all ordinary circumstances
they can make a business for
themselves. If they have little money
and live within their means they will find
it growing on their hands fast enough for
their good. If they go largely on credit
they will be in danger when a panic
comes. Let a young man keep safely
within due limits, be content with moderate
gains, ask of the Lord “a prudent
wife,” and take his place among the true
and strong men of the land and the world.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
